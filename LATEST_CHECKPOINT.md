# LATEST CHECKPOINT - 2025-10-28 03:40

## 🔒 CURRENT: Pre Schema Migration - Geographic Standardization

### Quick Restore Commands
```bash
# To restore database
node restore-database-snapshot.js 2025-10-28T03-40-05

# To restore code
git restore .
```

### What's Working
- ✅ **Algorithm Manager**: localStorage persistence (remembers last town)
- ✅ **Scoring Synchronization**: Fixed 77% vs 80% discrepancy (v2.2.0)
- ✅ **Database**: 352 towns, no duplicate names globally
- ✅ **Geographic Data**: Comprehensive region field for all countries
- ✅ **All Systems**: Fully operational and tested

### What We're About To Do
**MAJOR SCHEMA MIGRATION - Geographic Data Standardization**
- Rename `name` → `town_name` (AI and human friendly)
- Add `country_code` (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2: US, AE, CA)
- Add `subdivision_code` (ISO 3166-2: FL, AZ, ON)
- Update ~50+ files across entire codebase
- **HIGH RISK / HIGH REWARD**

### Why This Migration?
- Generic `name` column causes 10+ minute delays EVERY session
- Need ISO standards for future growth (multiple Gainesvilles)
- One-time pain for permanent operational efficiency

## 🚨 CRITICAL WARNINGS

**BEFORE PROCEEDING WITH MIGRATION:**
- ✅ Database snapshot created (2025-10-28T03-40-05)

- ⚠️  Do NOT drop old `name` column until fully verified

**ABORT CRITERIA:**
- If >10 breaking errors occur during migration
- If core functionality breaks and can't be quickly fixed
- If migration takes >2 hours without progress
- User requests abort
