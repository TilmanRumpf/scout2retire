## ✅ Compound Buttons Persistence Fixed

### Status: FULLY WORKING
All 10 compound buttons now auto-save and persist correctly after browser refresh.

### What Was Fixed:
1. **Museums & History button persistence** - User confirmed working
2. **React state closure issue** - Auto-save now uses fresh data
3. **All compound buttons** - Walking & Cycling, Golf & Tennis, etc.

### Key Achievement:
Fixed critical bug where compound button selections were lost on refresh unless user clicked Next button. Now auto-saves within 1.5 seconds.

### Quick Test:
1. Go to http://localhost:5173/onboarding/hobbies
2. Click any compound button (e.g., Museums & History)
3. Wait 1.5 seconds
4. Refresh browser
5. Button should still be selected ✅
