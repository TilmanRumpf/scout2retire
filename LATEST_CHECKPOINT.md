# üü¢ LATEST CHECKPOINT - October 17, 2025 01:45 UTC

## ‚ú® COMPONENT-BASED SCORING - Healthcare & Safety Quality Scores

**Full Details:** [docs/project-history/2025-10-17-component-based-scoring.md](docs/project-history/2025-10-17-component-based-scoring.md)

**What Was Achieved:**
- Implemented 3-component Healthcare scoring (Quality + Accessibility + Cost = 0-10.0)
- Implemented 3-component Safety scoring (Base + Crime Impact + Environmental = 0-10.0)
- Replaced static admin scores with transparent, dynamic calculations
- Tested with 10 real database towns - all calculations verified

**Key Results:**
- Healthcare average: 4.76/10.0 (down from inflated 7.3 static scores - more realistic)
- Safety average: 8.31/10.0 (up from 7.8 with crime bonuses)
- Charlottetown, PEI: 8.3 healthcare, 9.6 safety (excellent)
- Bubaque, Guinea-Bissau: 1.2 healthcare, 7.5 safety (limited remote island)
- Full component transparency via breakdown functions

**Restoration:**
```bash
git checkout c402e93  # Component-based scoring commit
# No database changes needed - scores calculated on-the-fly
```

## üí∞ PREVIOUS CHECKPOINT - October 15, 2025 21:17 PST

### CANADIAN CURRENCY FIX - Nova Scotia Now Affordable!

**Full Details:** [docs/project-history/CHECKPOINT_2025-10-15_CANADIAN_CURRENCY_FIX.md](docs/project-history/CHECKPOINT_2025-10-15_CANADIAN_CURRENCY_FIX.md)

**Critical Bug Fixed:**
- All 20 Canadian towns had costs in CAD mislabeled as USD
- Converted to true USD values (0.71 exchange rate)
- Nova Scotia matches improved from 0/11 to 6/11 towns for $2,000 budget
- Average cost score improved 166% (17.9 ‚Üí 47.7 out of 100)

**Restoration:**
```bash
node restore-database-snapshot.js 2025-10-15T21-17-25

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING NOW

### Component-Based Scoring System
- ‚úÖ **Healthcare Scoring** (0-10.0 scale)
  - Quality (0-4.0): Admin baseline + hospital count
  - Accessibility (0-3.0): Distance + emergency + English doctors
  - Cost (0-3.0): Insurance + affordability
  - Full backwards compatibility with database fields

- ‚úÖ **Safety Scoring** (0-10.0 scale)
  - Base Safety (0-7.0): Admin baseline capped
  - Crime Impact (-1.0 to +2.0): Bonus OR penalty
  - Environmental (0-1.0): Health + disaster risk
  - Crime bonuses reward extremely safe locations

### Real-World Examples
```
Charlottetown, PEI:
  Healthcare: 8.3 (Quality 2.7 + Access 3.0 + Cost 2.6)
  Safety: 9.6 (Base 7.0 + Crime +2.0 + Env 0.6)

Bubaque, Guinea-Bissau:
  Healthcare: 1.2 (Quality 1.2 + Access 0.0 + Cost 0.0)
  Safety: 7.5 (Base 7.0 + Crime 0.0 + Env 0.5)

Porto, Portugal:
  Healthcare: 8.3 (Quality 3.0 + Access 3.0 + Cost 2.3)
  Safety: 9.5 (Base 7.0 + Crime +2.0 + Env 0.5)
```

### Performance Revolution (Oct 8)
- **Chat loads in 420ms** (down from 2000ms - 79% faster!)
- **Database queries: 91.5% reduction** (~200 ‚Üí ~17 queries)
- **Zero re-render storms** (8+ renders ‚Üí 1-2 renders)
- **Clean console** (removed 67 debug logs)

## üîÑ HOW TO TEST

**Component-Based Scoring:**
```bash
# Run verification with real database data
node archive/debug-2025-10/verify-scoring-with-real-data.js

# Expected output:
# - 10 towns with component breakdowns
# - Healthcare average ~4.76/10.0
# - Safety average ~8.31/10.0
```

**Manual Testing:**
```javascript
import { calculateHealthcareScore, getHealthcareBonusBreakdown } from './src/utils/scoring/helpers/calculateHealthcareScore.js';

const town = await supabase.from('towns').select('*').eq('name', 'Porto').single();
const score = calculateHealthcareScore(town.data);
const breakdown = getHealthcareBonusBreakdown(town.data);

console.log('Score:', score);
console.log('Components:', breakdown);
```

```bash
git revert c402e93
# Or restore to previous commit:
git checkout f6e4b29  # Before component-based scoring
```

**Restore Canadian Currency Fix:**

## üí° WHAT WAS ACHIEVED

### Score Transparency Revolution
**Before:**
- Static scores: `healthcare_score: 7.5` (why 7.5? nobody knows)
- No way to explain differences between towns
- Couldn't capture nuance (expensive vs cheap healthcare)

**After:**
- Component breakdown: Quality 2.5 + Access 2.2 + Cost 2.5 = 7.2
- Every point has a clear source
- Chiang Mai's low cost now properly reflected
- Full transparency via `getHealthcareBonusBreakdown()`

### Real Data Insights
1. **Healthcare scores were inflated**:
   - Old average: 7.3/10.0 (static admin scores)
   - New average: 4.76/10.0 (component-based reality)
   - Many towns had high admin scores but lacked supporting data

2. **Safety scores more accurate**:
   - Old average: 7.8/10.0
   - New average: 8.31/10.0
   - Crime bonuses properly reward safe locations

3. **Architecture Clarity**:
   - Component-Based (0-10): Healthcare, Safety - Objective quality
   - Preference Matching (0-100%): Climate, Cost, Culture - Subjective fit

## üéØ DATABASE STATE

**No Database Changes Needed:**
- Scores calculated on-the-fly, not stored
- Uses existing fields: `healthcare_score`, `safety_score`, `crime_rate`, etc.
- Fully backwards compatible with old field names
- Supports multiple field name variants (old/new schemas)

**Fields Used:**
- Healthcare: `healthcare_score`, `hospital_count`, `nearest_major_hospital_km`, `english_speaking_doctors`, `emergency_services_quality`, `insurance_availability_rating`, `healthcare_cost`
- Safety: `safety_score`, `crime_rate`, `environmental_health_rating`, `natural_disaster_risk`, `natural_disaster_risk_score`

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN ISSUES

**None!** All tests passing with real database data.

**Minor Notes:**
- Healthcare scores dropped significantly (7.3 ‚Üí 4.76) - this is CORRECT, old scores were inflated
- Safety scores increased slightly (7.8 ‚Üí 8.31) - crime bonuses working as intended
- Some towns have missing data (crime_rate, insurance_rating) - handled gracefully with neutral defaults

---
