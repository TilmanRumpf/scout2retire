### What's Working
- ✅ **Collapsible Top Matches on mobile** - Starts collapsed, Featured Town visible first
- ✅ **Compact town cards** - Name and percentage on same line (no wrapping)
- ✅ **Chat lobby like buttons** - Heart icons on Popular Country Lounges
- ✅ **Clean header** - Logo only, no "Scout2Retire" text at any resolution
- ✅ **Favorites page polish** - No count in title

### Key Achievement
**MOBILE-FIRST DAILY PAGE**: Eliminated scroll fatigue by making Top Matches collapsible on mobile/tablet. Featured Town and Today's Inspiration now appear immediately without scrolling through 8-10 text links. Added missing heart buttons to Popular Country Lounges in Chat Lobby for consistent UX.
