# Match Scores Fix Verification

## Issue Fixed
The match percentage scores were not displaying in the upper left corner of town photo overlays because the database queries were trying to SELECT non-existent columns (`matchScore`, `categoryScores`, `finalScore`) from the database.

## Root Cause
The scoring columns don't exist as actual database columns - they are calculated in-memory by the matching algorithm and added to town objects during the scoring process.

## Files Modified
1. **`/src/utils/townUtils.jsx`** - Removed non-existent scoring columns from SELECT statement
2. **`/src/utils/matchingAlgorithm.js`** - Removed non-existent scoring columns from SELECT statement

## Fix Applied
Removed the following columns from database SELECT statements:
- `categoryScores`
- `matchScore` 
- `finalScore`

These values are now properly calculated and added by the `scoreTownsBatch()` function in `unifiedScoring.js`.

## Verification Steps

### 1. Browser Console Test
Open the Towns page at http://localhost:5173/towns and run this in the browser console:

```javascript
// Check if towns have match scores after personalized fetch
const testUser = 'd1039857-71e2-4562-86aa-1f0b4a0c17c8';
import('./src/utils/townUtils.jsx').then(async ({ fetchTowns }) => {
  const result = await fetchTowns({ 
    userId: testUser, 
    usePersonalization: true, 
    limit: 3 
  });
  
  if (result.success && result.towns.length > 0) {
    console.log('✅ Match scores working:');
    result.towns.forEach(town => {
      console.log(`${town.name}: ${town.matchScore}% match`);
    });
  } else {
    console.log('❌ Issue detected:', result.error);
  }
});
```

### 2. Visual Verification
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/towns
2. Log in with a user account that has completed onboarding
3. Look for percentage scores in the upper left corner of town photo overlays
4. Scores should appear as colored badges (green for high scores, blue for medium, yellow for low)

### 3. Expected Behavior
- **Without personalization**: Towns load without match scores (no overlay percentages)
- **With personalization**: Towns load with calculated match scores displayed in upper left corner
- **TownImageOverlay component**: Checks `if (matchScore !== undefined && matchScore !== null)` before displaying
- **Color coding**: 
  - 80%+ = High (green)
  - 60%+ = Medium (blue) 
  - <60% = Low (yellow)

## Component Flow
1. Page calls `fetchTowns({ userId, usePersonalization: true })`
2. `fetchTowns` routes to `getPersonalizedTowns()`
3. `getPersonalizedTowns` fetches raw town data from database
4. `scoreTownsBatch()` calculates match scores and adds them to town objects
5. Town objects now have `matchScore` property
6. `TownImageOverlay` receives `matchScore={town.matchScore}` prop
7. Overlay displays percentage in upper left corner

## Files That Display Match Scores
- `TownImageOverlay.jsx` - Main overlay component (upper left corner)
- `TownDiscovery.jsx` - Main towns page
- `Favorites.jsx` - Favorites page  
- `TownComparison.jsx` - Comparison page
- `DailyTownCard.jsx` - Daily town widget
- `OnboardingComplete.jsx` - Onboarding results

All these components pass `matchScore={town.matchScore}` to TownImageOverlay and expect the scoring data to be present.
