```bash
# Manual browser testing
# Open browser manually
# Click through app manually
# Take screenshots manually
```

**NEW:**
```
Agent Chat: "Test the complete user registration and town search flow"
‚Üí Agent uses Playwright MCP to automate testing, capture results
```

### Pattern 3: Research-Driven Development
**OLD:**
```bash
# Manual research
# Google for best practices
# Copy-paste solutions
```

**NEW:**
```
Agent Chat: "Research and implement best practices for location-based search UX"
‚Üí Agent uses DeepWiki + Ref MCP to research, then implements solution
```

## üìä MCP-ENHANCED CLEANUP STRATEGY

### Automated Analysis
```
Agent Chat: "Analyze the codebase and identify unused components, imports, and database columns"
‚Üí Uses file system + database analysis to provide comprehensive cleanup report
```

### Intelligent Suggestions
```
Agent Chat: "Research and suggest modern alternatives to our current tech stack components"
‚Üí Uses research MCP to find better alternatives, performance comparisons
```

### Testing-Driven Cleanup
```
Agent Chat: "Before cleaning up old components, test that new ones work correctly"
‚Üí Uses Playwright to verify functionality before deletion
```

## üö® CRITICAL MCP USAGE RULES

### 1. ALWAYS USE AGENT MODE
- ‚ùå "Ask" or "Edit" mode (MCP servers not available)
- ‚úÖ "Agent" mode (all MCP servers accessible)

### 2. LEVERAGE MCP BEFORE MANUAL WORK
- ‚ùå Create manual scripts for database analysis
- ‚úÖ Use Supabase MCP through Agent chat
- ‚ùå Manually test UI flows
- ‚úÖ Use Playwright MCP for automated testing
- ‚ùå Guess at best practices
- ‚úÖ Use research MCPs for informed decisions

### 3. COMBINE MCP CAPABILITIES
```
Example: "Research best practices for user onboarding (DeepWiki), then test our current onboarding flow (Playwright), then analyze completion rates from the database (Supabase)"
```

## üéØ IMMEDIATE MCP OPPORTUNITIES

### 1. Photo Analysis Project
```
Agent Chat: "Use the database to find all towns missing photos, research best practices for town photo requirements, then suggest an implementation plan"
```

### 2. Performance Optimization
```
Agent Chat: "Analyze current database performance, research Supabase optimization techniques, then implement the most impactful improvements"
```

### 3. Testing Infrastructure
```
Agent Chat: "Create automated tests for all critical user flows, starting with registration and town search"
```

### 4. Code Quality Assessment
```
Agent Chat: "Analyze the codebase for unused components, research modern React patterns, then suggest and implement improvements"
```

## üèÜ MCP SUCCESS METRICS

Track these improvements from MCP usage:
- **Database queries analyzed**: Target 100% of slow queries
- **Test coverage**: Achieve 80% automated test coverage
- **Research-driven decisions**: Document all major changes with research backing
- **Code cleanup**: Remove 30% dead code through intelligent analysis

## üìã DAILY MCP WORKFLOW

### Morning Standup with MCP
```
1. "Analyze yesterday's database performance"
2. "Check if any tests are failing" 
3. "Research any new issues in the codebase"
4. "Suggest today's optimization priorities"
```

### Development Session with MCP
```
1. Research ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Verify
2. Use research MCPs for planning
3. Use database MCP for implementation
4. Use testing MCP for verification
```

### End-of-Day Review with MCP
```
