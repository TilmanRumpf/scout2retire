## 🔧 WHAT WAS FIXED

### THE PROBLEM:
Users who provided **detailed budget information** (total budget + rent + healthcare) were being **penalized 50%** on their budget score.

**Example:**
- User sets: Budget $3000, Rent $1200, Healthcare $200
- System detected: "Power User" (3 fields)
- Applied penalty: **-50% to budget score**
- Result: **Lower match scores** for being thorough

### THE FIX:
- ✅ Removed `isSimpleBudgetUser` penalty logic
- ✅ All users get **same base budget score** (55-70 pts)
- ✅ Rent/Healthcare are **BONUS points** (+20/+10)
- ✅ More detail = **HIGHER scores** (not penalties)

---

## 📈 USER IMPACT

### Before Fix (OLD):
```
Budget $3000 vs Cost $2900 (1.03x ratio)
├─ Base budget: 33 pts (50% penalty!)
├─ Rent match: 30 pts
└─ Tax: 15 pts
TOTAL: 78/100
```

### After Fix (NEW):
```
Budget $3000 vs Cost $2900 (1.03x ratio)
├─ Base budget: 55 pts (no penalty)
├─ Rent bonus: +20 pts
└─ Tax: 8 pts
TOTAL: 83/100
```

**Improvement:** +5 points (6.4% increase)

### Real-World Impact:
- **Budget-Conscious Retiree**: +8 to +13 points per town
- **Comfortable Retiree**: +11 to +12 points per town
- **Overall Score**: +1 to +2.3 points (19% category weight)
