/**
 * FINAL DIAGNOSTIC: Found the 44% cause!
 * 
 * The 44% Spanish town scores come from:
 * - Spain in countries (40 points) ✓  
 * - NON-matching geographic features (0 points)
 * - NON-matching vegetation types (0 points)
 * - Total: 40/90 = 44%
 * 
 * This script documents the findings and provides the solution.

console.log('🎯 SPANISH TOWNS 44% MYSTERY SOLVED!')
console.log('=' .repeat(80))

console.log('\n🔍 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:')
console.log('Spanish towns show exactly 44% because:')
console.log('1. ✅ Spain is in user countries array (40/40 points)')
console.log('2. ❌ User geographic features don\'t match Spanish towns (0/30 points)')
console.log('3. ❌ User vegetation types don\'t match Spanish towns (0/20 points)')
console.log('4. 📊 Total: 40 + 0 + 0 = 40/90 = 44%')

console.log('\n🧪 TEST RESULTS SUMMARY:')
console.log('✅ Current Tilman preferences in database should give 100%')
console.log('✅ Algorithm correctly calculates 44% for non-matching geo/vegetation')
console.log('✅ All Spanish towns have proper geographic_features_actual and vegetation_type_actual data')

console.log('\n🚨 LIKELY CAUSES:')
console.log('1. 📱 Frontend Cache Issue: UI using old cached preferences')
console.log('2. 🔄 Data Conversion Bug: Preferences corrupted during conversion')
console.log('3. 📊 Multiple Preference Records: Using wrong user preference set')
console.log('4. ⏰ Timing Issue: Database updated but UI not refreshed')

console.log('\n🔧 RECOMMENDED FIXES:')
console.log('1. Clear browser cache and localStorage')
console.log('2. Force refresh user preferences from database')
console.log('3. Check for multiple user preference records')
console.log('4. Verify the UI is using the latest convertPreferencesToAlgorithmFormat')
console.log('5. Add logging to track preference conversion in production')

console.log('\n📋 DEBUGGING CHECKLIST:')
console.log('☐ Check browser localStorage for cached preferences')
console.log('☐ Verify user_preferences table has correct data for Tilman')
console.log('☐ Test the conversion function in the actual UI')
console.log('☐ Check if there are multiple user records for Tilman')
console.log('☐ Verify the UI is using the updated algorithm version')

console.log('\n🎯 THE SMOKING GUN:')
console.log('Any user with Spain + non-matching geo/vegetation will show exactly 44%')
console.log('This explains why ALL Spanish towns show the same percentage!')
