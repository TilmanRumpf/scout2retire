# SWIPE NAVIGATION DEBUG RESULTS

## Issues Found and Fixed:

### ❌ Issue #1: Global CSS Blocking Swipes  
**Problem**: `overscroll-behavior: none` in index.css prevented swipe detection
**Fix**: Changed to `overscroll-behavior: contain` to allow controlled swipes

### ❌ Issue #2: SwipeableOnboardingContent Configuration
**Problem**: 
- `preventScrollOnSwipe: true` blocked vertical scrolling
- `delta: 30` was too high for mobile
- Missing iOS-specific touch configuration
- No debug logging for troubleshooting

**Fix**: 
- Set `preventScrollOnSwipe: false` to allow vertical scrolling
- Reduced `delta: 25` for easier mobile swipes  
- Added `touchEventOptions: { passive: false }` for iOS
- Added comprehensive debug logging
- Set proper `touchAction: 'pan-y pinch-zoom'` for iOS Safari
- Added `overscrollBehavior: 'contain'` to the swipe container

### ❌ Issue #3: Container Structure Issues
**Problem**: Swipe container didn't have proper height and positioning
**Fix**: Added proper height calculation and positioning styles

### ❌ Issue #4: iOS Header CSS Conflicts
**Problem**: CSS potentially blocking touch events in header area
**Fix**: Ensured `pointer-events: auto` is set properly

## Testing Instructions:

1. Open app on iOS Safari/Chrome on mobile device
2. Navigate to any onboarding step (e.g. `/onboarding/current-status`)
3. Check browser console for debug messages:
   - `[SWIPE] Touch started` - when you start touching
   - `[SWIPE] Swiping:` - while swiping with direction data
   - `[SWIPE] Detected LEFT swipe - moving to next step` - on successful left swipe
   - `[SWIPE] Detected RIGHT swipe - moving to previous step` - on successful right swipe
4. Try swiping left/right on the main content area (not header)
5. Verify you can still scroll vertically within forms

## Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Swipe LEFT → Next onboarding step
- ✅ Swipe RIGHT → Previous onboarding step  
- ✅ Vertical scrolling still works
- ✅ Header navigation still works
- ✅ Debug messages appear in console

## If Still Not Working:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify react-swipeable version is 7.0.2
3. Test on actual iOS device (not just desktop Chrome)
4. Check if any parent elements have `touch-action: none`
