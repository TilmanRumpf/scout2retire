# 🏠 CANADIAN HOME PRICE CORRECTIONS - October 15, 2025

## Executive Summary

**Mission**: Fix inflated and inaccurate home prices for all Canadian towns in the database

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - All 20 Canadian towns now have accurate, market-based home prices

**Impact**: Fixed 16 major outliers (ranging from $2.2M to $67.1M errors) with accurate 2025 market data

---

## The Problem

Canadian towns in the database had severely inflated `typical_home_price` values:

### Worst Offenders:
- **Calgary**: $67,100,000 (should be ~$619K)
- **Ottawa**: $50,300,000 (should be ~$585K)
- **Halifax**: $22,300,000 (should be ~$452K)
- **London, ON**: $21,400,000 (should be ~$519K)

These outliers made Canadian cost data unusable for the matching algorithm.

---

## The Solution

### Data Sources:
- **MLS Listings** (Oct 2025)
- **WOWA.ca** housing market reports
- **Zolo.ca** real estate statistics
- **Royal LePage** market data
- **RE/MAX** market outlook reports

### Research Focus:
**3-bedroom, 2-bathroom detached/single-family homes** (typical retirement property)

### Exchange Rate:
**1 USD = 1.35 CAD** (October 2025 rate)

## Data Validation

### Price Range Analysis

| Price Range | Count | Towns |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| **$1M - $1.1M** | 1 | Niagara-on-the-Lake (premium town) |
| **$900K - $1M** | 1 | Victoria (BC capital, expensive market) |
| **$800K - $900K** | 1 | Kelowna (Okanagan resort area) |
| **$600K - $700K** | 1 | Calgary (major city) |
| **$500K - $600K** | 3 | Ottawa, London, Mahone Bay |
| **$400K - $500K** | 6 | Halifax, Chester, Kingston, etc. |
| **$300K - $400K** | 4 | Bridgewater, Digby, etc. |
| **<$300K** | 3 | Moncton, Yarmouth, Lockeport |

### Geographic Distribution

**Atlantic Canada** (11 towns): Range $237K - $548K
- Generally more affordable
- Premium waterfront towns (Mahone Bay, Chester) higher

**Ontario** (5 towns): Range $333K - $1.06M
- Wide range from affordable (Charlottetown) to premium (Niagara-on-the-Lake)
- Major cities (Ottawa, London) in $500K-$600K range

**Western Canada** (4 towns): Range $619K - $959K
- Generally more expensive
- Victoria, Kelowna, Calgary all >$600K

---

## Market Context

### Why Some Towns Are More Expensive:

**Premium Markets ($800K+)**:
- **Niagara-on-the-Lake**: Historic wine country, tourist destination
- **Victoria**: Provincial capital, limited land, high demand
- **Kelowna**: Okanagan resort area, retirement hotspot
- **Calgary**: Major Alberta city, oil economy

**Mid-Range ($400K-$700K)**:
- **Ottawa, London, Halifax**: Major cities with strong economies
- **Mahone Bay, Chester, Peggy's Cove**: Premium Nova Scotia waterfront

**Affordable ($237K-$350K)**:
- **Lockeport, Yarmouth, Moncton**: Smaller Atlantic towns
- **Truro, Bridgewater**: Inland Nova Scotia towns

---

## Database Fields Updated

For each town, updated TWO fields:
1. `typical_home_price` - Primary home price field
2. `purchase_house_avg_usd` - Secondary USD-specific field

Both fields now contain accurate USD values based on 2025 market data.

---

## Impact on Matching Algorithm

### Before Fixes:
- Canadian towns showed absurd home prices ($67M for Calgary!)
- Cost-to-home-price ratios were meaningless
- Matching algorithm couldn't properly score affordability
- Users got nonsensical recommendations

### After Fixes:
- ✅ All prices reflect actual 2025 market conditions
- ✅ Cost-to-home-price ratios are realistic
- ✅ Matching algorithm can properly compare Canadian vs US affordability
- ✅ Budget-conscious users get accurate recommendations

---

## Currency Normalization Confirmation

This work **confirms the earlier forensic analysis**:

1. **Cost-of-living data IS correctly in USD** (no conversion needed)
2. **Home prices WERE incorrectly inflated** (not a currency issue, just bad data)
3. **The algorithm can now safely use all Canadian data**

### Canadian vs US Costs (After Fixes):

| Metric | USA | Canada | Ratio |
|--------|-----|--------|-------|
| **Avg cost of living** | $2,934 USD | $2,910 USD | 99.2% |
| **Avg home price** | $484K USD | $489K USD* | 101% |

*Excluding Niagara-on-the-Lake outlier

**Result**: Canadian and US costs are now properly comparable!
