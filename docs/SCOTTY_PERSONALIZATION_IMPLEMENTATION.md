## How Personalization Works

1. **Context Loading**: When ScottyGuide component mounts, it fetches the user's complete profile
2. **Prompt Enhancement**: User context is formatted and included in Scotty's system prompt
3. **Personalized Responses**: Scotty references specific user details when relevant
4. **Smart Defaults**: If user hasn't completed onboarding, Scotty still works but with generic responses

## Example Personalized Interactions

### Before Personalization:
> "Portugal requires most non-EU citizens to obtain a D7 visa for retirement."

### After Personalization (US Citizen):
> "As a US citizen, you'll need Portugal's D7 visa, which requires proof of around $1,500/month in passive income. The process typically takes 2-4 months."

### After Personalization (EU Citizen):
> "Great news! As a German citizen, you can move to Portugal freely without any visa - just register as a resident after 3 months."

## Testing Personalization

```javascript
// In browser console on /scotty page:
import { verifyContextLoading } from './src/utils/testScottyPersonalization';

// Replace with actual user ID
verifyContextLoading('user-id-here');
```

## Privacy & Security
- User context is only loaded for the authenticated user
- No context sharing between users
- Sensitive data (like exact budget) used carefully in responses
- All personalization respects user privacy

## Future Enhancements
1. **Conversation Memory**: Store Scotty conversations with context
2. **Dynamic Updates**: Refresh context when user updates preferences
3. **Context Indicators**: Visual cues showing what data Scotty is using
4. **Preference Toggle**: Let users control how much personalization they want
5. **Multi-language Support**: Respond in user's preferred language

## Maintenance Notes
- When adding new onboarding fields, update `getUserContext()` 
- Test personalization after any user data schema changes
- Monitor for any PII leakage in responses
- Keep persona prompt concise to leave room for user context
