## Quick Stats

| Metric | Count | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|

## Top 3 Critical Issues

### 1. Canadian Healthcare Costs = $0 🔴
**Impact:** 20 towns
**Issue:** All Canadian towns show $0 monthly healthcare cost (unrealistic)
**Cause:** Universal healthcare ≠ zero out-of-pocket expenses
**Fix:** Set to $75/month (prescriptions, dental, optometry average)

**SQL Fix:**
```sql
UPDATE towns
SET healthcare_cost_monthly = 75, healthcare_cost = 75
WHERE country = 'Canada' AND healthcare_cost_monthly = 0;
```

**Estimated time:** 5 minutes
**Risk:** Low

---

### 2. Quality of Life Lacks Granularity 🟡
**Impact:** 342 towns (97.2% of database)
**Issue:** 97% of towns score either 8 or 9 (only 2 values used)
**Problem:** Cannot differentiate between towns - scoring too coarse

**Current Distribution:**
- Score 9: 192 towns (54.5%)
- Score 8: 150 towns (42.6%)
- Score 7: 9 towns (2.6%)
- Score 6: 1 town (0.3%)

**Recommendation:**
1. Implement decimal scoring (7.5, 8.2, 8.9, etc.)
2. Re-evaluate scoring methodology
3. Add more differentiation criteria

**Estimated time:** 2-3 hours
**Risk:** Medium (requires methodology review)

---

### 3. 20 Completely Empty Columns 🗑️
**Impact:** 20 columns (10.5% of schema)
**Issue:** Zero data in 20 columns across all 352 towns
**Problem:** Database bloat, unused infrastructure features

**Affected Columns:**
- Transportation: regional_airport_distance, international_airport_distance, bike_infrastructure, road_quality, traffic_congestion, parking_availability
- Connectivity: internet_reliability, mobile_coverage
- Infrastructure: banking_infrastructure, digital_services_availability
- Activities: sports_facilities, mountain_activities, water_sports_available, cultural_activities
- Other: image_url_3, image_urls, expat_groups, international_flights_direct, nearest_major_city, timezone

**Recommendation:** Drop all 20 columns (reduces schema complexity by 10.5%)

**SQL Fix:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE towns
  DROP COLUMN image_url_3,
  DROP COLUMN image_urls,
  -- ... (see full script in DATA_QUALITY_AUDIT_2025-10-19.md)
```

**Estimated time:** 10 minutes
**Risk:** Low (data doesn't exist)

## Other Notable Findings

### Duplicate Cost Values (Possible Templates)
- **$2,793/month:** 30 US towns (exact same value)
- **$998/month:** 21 international towns
- **Assessment:** Likely templated values, not individual research
- **Action:** Manual review recommended

### High Missing Data Rates
| Category | Columns | Missing % | Action |
|----------|---------|-----------|--------|
| Infrastructure | 12 | 100% | Drop columns |
| Image metadata | 6 | 74-100% | Drop or populate |
| Visa/residency | 3 | 94-99% | Drop or populate |
| Healthcare details | 4 | 77-84% | Review |

### Valid Outliers (No Action Needed)
- **High costs:** Boulder ($4,830), Road Town BVI ($4,800) ✅ Accurate
- **High population:** Cairo (20.9M), Bangkok (10.5M) ✅ Metro areas
- **High pollution:** Goa (AQI 156), Kathmandu (140) ✅ Known issues
- **Low healthcare:** Bubaque (score 3) ✅ Remote island
