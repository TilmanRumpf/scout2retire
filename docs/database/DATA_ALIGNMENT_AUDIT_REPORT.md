## üöÄ Strategic Impact

**Current State**: Sophisticated AI enrichment system generating 60 fields, but matching algorithm only uses 13%

**Opportunity**: By integrating unused high-priority fields, the matching algorithm could become 3-4x more sophisticated and accurate for retirement-specific factors.

**Competitive Advantage**: Most destination-matching services use basic criteria. Full AI integration would create a uniquely sophisticated, personalized matching system that considers factors other platforms ignore.

**User Experience**: Better explanations, more accurate matches, and confidence in recommendations through AI-generated detailed factors.
