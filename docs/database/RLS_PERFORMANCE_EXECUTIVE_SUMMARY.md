# RLS Performance Optimization - Executive Summary

**Date:** October 26, 2025
**Analysis:** 68 migrations, 57 policies, 25 tables
**Total Effort:** 2-4 hours
**Risk Level:** LOW
**Expected Impact:** 10-30% faster auth queries

---

## TL;DR - What You Need to Know

Your database has **two performance issues** in Row Level Security (RLS) policies:

1. **Auth functions called too many times** - `auth.uid()` may be evaluated 100+ times when query returns 100 rows (should be 1 time)
2. **Multiple policies per table** - Some tables have 2-3 policies evaluated for every row

**Good news:** Both are easy to fix, low risk, and can be done incrementally.

---

## The Problem in Plain English

### Issue 1: Auth Function Re-evaluation

**What's happening:**
```
User queries notifications → Returns 100 rows
Current behavior: auth.uid() called 100 times ❌
Desired behavior: auth.uid() called 1 time ✅
```

**Why it matters:**
- Wasted database CPU
- Slower queries
- "Auth RLS Initialization Plan" warnings in logs

**How common:**
- Affects 24 tables
- 136 occurrences of auth.uid() across policies

### Issue 2: Multiple Permissive Policies

**What's happening:**
```
Table 'users' has 3 SELECT policies
Postgres evaluates: Policy1 OR Policy2 OR Policy3
Result: 3x evaluation overhead ❌
```

**Why it matters:**
- More work per row
- Harder to understand security logic
- Unnecessary complexity

**How common:**
- 7 table.command combinations affected
- Worst: group_chat_members (11 policies total)

---

## The Solution

### Phase 1: Cache Auth Functions (30 min, HIGH IMPACT)

**What to do:**
1. Create helper function `get_current_user_id()` that caches `auth.uid()`
2. Replace `auth.uid()` with `get_current_user_id()` in policies
3. Deploy to 10 simple tables first

**Why it's safe:**
- No logic changes
- Just caching optimization
- Easy to roll back

**Expected result:**
- 10-20% faster queries on affected tables
- No more "Auth RLS Initialization Plan" warnings

### Phase 2: Consolidate Policies (1-2 hours, MEDIUM IMPACT)

**What to do:**
1. Combine multiple policies into single policy with OR logic
2. Start with `users` table (3 SELECT policies → 1)
3. Continue with `group_chat_members` and `scotty_messages`

**Why it's safe:**
- Same security logic, different structure
- Requires testing, but straightforward
- Can do one table at a time

**Expected result:**
- Simpler security model
- 5-15% faster queries on affected tables
- Easier to maintain

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Read the Docs (5 min)

Three documents in `docs/database/`:

1. **RLS_PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS.md** - Detailed analysis (you're here)
2. **RLS_QUICK_FIX_MIGRATIONS.md** - Ready-to-deploy SQL migrations
3. **RLS_PERFORMANCE_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md** - This summary

### Step 2: Deploy Helper Functions (2 min)

```sql
-- Run this first
CREATE FUNCTION get_current_user_id() RETURNS UUID AS $$
  SELECT auth.uid()
$$ LANGUAGE SQL STABLE;
```

### Step 3: Fix High-Impact Tables (20 min)

In order of priority:
1. notifications (high read frequency)
2. scotty_conversations (growing rapidly)
3. thread_read_status (frequent updates)
4. scotty_chat_usage (analytics)
5. discovery_views (analytics)

**All migrations ready to copy/paste from RLS_QUICK_FIX_MIGRATIONS.md**

### Step 4: Test & Monitor (5 min)

```sql
-- Verify it works
SELECT * FROM notifications LIMIT 10;

-- Check performance
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM notifications LIMIT 100;
```

## Risk Assessment

### What Could Go Wrong?

**Scenario 1: Auth stops working**
- **Likelihood:** Very low
- **Impact:** High
- **Mitigation:** Test in staging first, deploy one table at a time, rollback ready
- **Recovery time:** < 5 minutes (run rollback migration)

**Scenario 2: Performance gets worse**
- **Likelihood:** Very low (should improve or stay same)
- **Impact:** Low-Medium
- **Mitigation:** Measure before/after, monitor logs
- **Recovery time:** < 5 minutes (rollback)

**Scenario 3: Users see data they shouldn't**
- **Likelihood:** Very low (no logic changes in Phase 1)
- **Impact:** Critical
- **Mitigation:** Thorough testing, gradual rollout
- **Recovery time:** Immediate rollback

### Safety Measures

✅ **All migrations have rollback versions**
✅ **Can deploy one table at a time**
✅ **Test in staging first**
✅ **No application code changes needed**
✅ **Monitoring queries provided**

## Prioritized Action Plan

### Today (30 min)

1. ✅ Read RLS_PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS.md (5 min)
2. ✅ Review RLS_QUICK_FIX_MIGRATIONS.md (5 min)
3. ⚠️ Deploy helper functions in staging (2 min)
4. ⚠️ Test helper functions work (2 min)
5. ⚠️ Deploy notifications optimization (3 min)
6. ⚠️ Test notifications still work (3 min)
7. ⚠️ Deploy remaining Phase 1 tables (10 min)
8. ⚠️ Monitor for issues (ongoing)

## FAQs

### Q: Do I need to change application code?

**A:** No, all changes are in database policies only.

### Q: Will this break existing functionality?

**A:** Very unlikely. Phase 1 has no logic changes. Test thoroughly for Phase 2.

### Q: Can I do just some tables?

**A:** Yes! Start with notifications (highest impact) and add more as comfortable.

### Q: What if something breaks?

**A:** Run the rollback migration. Each fix has a rollback version ready.

### Q: How do I know it worked?

**A:** Check query performance, verify no auth errors, see fewer warnings in logs.

### Q: Should I do this in production?

**A:** Test in staging first, then deploy during low-traffic hours with monitoring.
