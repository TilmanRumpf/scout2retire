## The Issues at a Glance

### Issue #1: Auth Function Re-evaluation ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH IMPACT
- **Problem:** `auth.uid()` called 100+ times when query returns 100 rows
- **Should be:** Called once, result cached
- **Affected:** 24 tables, 136 occurrences
- **Fix:** Use helper function `get_current_user_id()` (STABLE cached)
- **Effort:** 30 minutes
- **Risk:** LOW

### Issue #2: Multiple Permissive Policies ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM IMPACT
- **Problem:** 2-3 policies evaluated for every row (OR logic overhead)
- **Should be:** Single policy with OR conditions inside
- **Affected:** 7 table.command combinations
- **Fix:** Consolidate policies
- **Effort:** 1-2 hours
- **Risk:** LOW-MEDIUM

---

## Deployment Phases

### Phase 1: Auth Function Caching (30 min, HIGH ROI)
‚úÖ **Tables to fix:**
1. notifications (high read frequency)
2. thread_read_status (frequent updates)
3. scotty_chat_usage (growing usage)
4. discovery_views (analytics)
5. user_blocks (interaction checks)
6. user_device_history (admin tools)
7. scotty_conversations (chat history)
8. admin_score_adjustments (admin)

**Impact:** 10-20% faster queries, 90% fewer auth function calls

### Phase 2: Policy Consolidation (1-2 hours, MEDIUM ROI)
‚úÖ **Tables to consolidate:**
1. users (3 SELECT ‚Üí 1, 2 UPDATE ‚Üí 1)
2. group_chat_members (11 policies ‚Üí 4)
3. scotty_messages (2 SELECT ‚Üí 1)

**Impact:** 5-15% additional speedup, simpler security model

### Phase 3: Complex Subqueries (2-4 hours, OPTIONAL)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Only if needed** - Monitor first, optimize if proven necessary

---

## Key Findings

### Worst Offenders (by auth function usage)
1. **group_chat_members** - 13 auth calls, 11 policies
2. **users** - 8 auth calls, 6 policies
3. **scotty_conversations** - 4 auth calls, 3 policies
4. **notifications** - 3 auth calls, 2 policies
5. **thread_read_status** - 3 auth calls, 2 policies

### Tables with Multiple Policies
- **users**: 3 SELECT, 2 UPDATE policies
- **group_chat_members**: 3 SELECT, 3 INSERT, 3 DELETE, 2 UPDATE
- **scotty_messages**: 2 SELECT policies

### High-Impact Quick Wins
- **notifications** - Simple pattern, high read frequency ‚Üí Fix first
- **scotty_conversations** - Growing rapidly with Scotty usage
- **thread_read_status** - Frequent updates on every chat interaction

---

## Expected Results

### Before Optimization
```
Query: SELECT * FROM notifications WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
Returns: 100 rows
Auth calls: 100 (re-evaluated per row)
Time: 5ms
```

### After Phase 1
```
Query: SELECT * FROM notifications WHERE user_id = get_current_user_id()
Returns: 100 rows
Auth calls: 1 (cached)
Time: 3-4ms
Improvement: 20-40% faster
```

### After Phase 2
```
Additional: Fewer policy evaluations
Improvement: 5-15% additional speedup
Total: 25-55% faster queries
```
