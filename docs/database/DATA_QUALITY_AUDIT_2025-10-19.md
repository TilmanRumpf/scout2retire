# Data Quality Audit Report - October 19, 2025

**Database:** Towns table (352 towns, 190 columns)
**Audit Type:** Comprehensive data quality check for outliers, format inconsistencies, and data type mismatches
**Severity Levels:** ERROR (critical fixes needed), WARNING (review needed), INFO (for awareness)

---

## Executive Summary

### Overall Findings
- **Errors:** 3 (placeholder text in production data)
- **Warnings:** 66 (mostly high missing data rates + 1 unrealistic zero issue)
- **Info:** 101 (duplicate values, round numbers indicating estimates)

### Critical Issues (Immediate Action Needed)

#### 1. Canadian Towns: Healthcare Cost = $0 ❌
**Issue:** 20 Canadian towns have `healthcare_cost_monthly = 0`, which is unrealistic.
**Likely Cause:** Canada's universal healthcare system - should represent actual out-of-pocket costs, not $0.

**Affected Towns:**
- Annapolis Royal, Bridgewater, Calgary, Charlottetown, Chester, Digby, Halifax, Kelowna, Kingston, Lockeport, London (ON), Lunenburg, Mahone Bay, Moncton, Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ottawa, Peggy's Cove, Truro, Victoria, Yarmouth

**Recommended Fix:**
```javascript
// Canadian healthcare: ~$50-100/month for prescriptions, dental, optometry
UPDATE towns
SET healthcare_cost_monthly = 75
WHERE country = 'Canada' AND healthcare_cost_monthly = 0;
```

#### 2. Placeholder Text in Production Columns 🔴
**Issue:** Found placeholder text containing "test", "fall", "spring" in `cultural_landmark_1`, `climate_description`, and `search_vector`.

**Examples:**
- Portland: "International Rose Test Garden" (contains "test")
- Multiple Croatia/Greece towns: Climate descriptions mentioning "fall" (US term, inconsistent with "autumn" used elsewhere)

**Action:** Manual review needed - determine if "test" garden is legitimate or if these are actual placeholders.

## Data Quality Issues by Category

### A. Outliers (Statistically Valid but Extreme Values)

#### Cost of Living Outliers (>$4000/month)
| Town | Country | Monthly Cost | Rent 1-bed | Status |
|------|---------|--------------|------------|--------|
| Boulder | USA | $4,830 | $2,100 | ✅ Valid (expensive college town) |
| Road Town | BVI | $4,800 | $2,000 | ✅ Valid (island premium) |
| Bend | USA | $4,140 | $1,800 | ✅ Valid (popular retirement destination) |
| Sarasota | USA | $4,140 | $1,800 | ✅ Valid (Florida retiree hub) |
| Austin | USA | $4,025 | $1,750 | ✅ Valid (booming tech city) |

**Assessment:** All outliers are legitimate - no action needed.

#### Healthcare Score Outlier
- **Bubaque, Guinea-Bissau:** Score = 3 (only town <5)
  - **Status:** ✅ Likely valid (remote island, limited infrastructure)

#### Population Outliers (>5M)
| Town | Population | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Cairo | 20,900,000 | Metro area, not town proper |
| Bangkok | 10,539,000 | Metro area |
| Ho Chi Minh City | 9,000,000 | Metro area |
| Singapore | 5,686,000 | City-state (entire country) |
| Sydney | 5,312,200 | Metro area |

**Recommendation:** These are valid but represent metro areas. Consider adding `population_type` column (town/metro/city-state) for clarity.

#### Air Quality Outliers (AQI >100)
| Town | AQI | Status |
|------|-----|--------|
| Goa, India | 156 | ✅ Valid |
| Kathmandu, Nepal | 140 | ✅ Valid |
| Cairo, Egypt | 128 | ✅ Valid |
| Pondicherry, India | 120 | ✅ Valid |

**Assessment:** All are known for pollution - data is accurate.

### B. Format Inconsistencies & Data Patterns

#### 1. Duplicate Values (Possible Copy-Paste Errors)

**Cost of Living - Most Duplicated:**
- **$2,793/month:** Appears in 30 US towns
  - Honolulu, Boise, Charleston, Myrtle Beach, Fort Myers, Jacksonville, Palm Beach, Orlando, Venice (FL), Portland, etc.
  - **Assessment:** 🟡 Suspiciously exact - likely templated value for "average US coastal retirement town"
  - **Recommendation:** Review if all 30 towns truly have identical costs

- **$998/month:** Appears in 21 towns
  - Puerto Plata, Philipsburg, Charlotte Amalie, Plettenberg Bay, Asunción, Providenciales, etc.
  - **Assessment:** 🟡 Likely templated value for "affordable international towns"

- **$950/month:** Appears in 11 Spanish towns
  - **Assessment:** ✅ More believable - similar costs across Spanish coastal towns

#### 2. Quality of Life Score Duplicates
- **Score = 9:** 192 towns (54% of database)
- **Score = 8:** 150 towns (43% of database)
- **Total with 8 or 9:** 97% of all towns

**Assessment:** 🔴 **MAJOR ISSUE** - Quality of life scoring lacks granularity. Only 2 values used for 97% of towns.

**Recommendation:**
1. Implement decimal scoring (7.5, 8.2, 8.7, etc.) for more precision
2. Re-evaluate scoring criteria - too many towns bunched at 8-9
3. Consider 10-point scale with more distribution

#### 3. Round Numbers (Likely Estimates)

**Population:**
- 349/352 towns (99%) have round numbers (50000, 100000, etc.)
- **Assessment:** ✅ Normal - population data is typically rounded

**Healthcare Costs:**
- 300/351 towns (85%) end in 00 ($200, $300, $400, etc.)
- **Assessment:** 🟡 Acceptable but indicates estimates, not precise data

**Home Prices:**
- 114/134 towns (85%) are round numbers ($180,000, $250,000, etc.)
- **Assessment:** ✅ Normal for real estate averages

| image_url_2 | 96.6% | 340/352 | 🟡 Nearly empty |
| image_photographer | 96.6% | 340/352 | 🟡 Nearly empty |

**Recommendation:**
1. **Immediate:** Drop 100% empty columns to reduce database bloat (20 columns)
2. **Consider:** Drop 96%+ empty columns unless actively being populated
3. **Estimated impact:** Remove ~22 columns (11% reduction in schema complexity)

#### High Missing Rates (>70%)
| Category | Columns | Missing % |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Image metadata | 6 columns | 74-100% |
| Healthcare details | 4 columns | 77-84% |
| Visa/residency | 3 columns | 94-99% |
| Infrastructure | 12 columns | 100% |
| Activities | 4 columns | 92-100% |

**Assessment:** These appear to be planned features not yet implemented. Either populate or remove.

### D. Geographic Features Analysis

#### Rare/Unique Combinations (Possible Typos)

**Geographic Features (19 rare combinations):**
- "coastal,island,beaches,mangroves,archipelago" - Bubaque (only)
- "coastal,desert,plains,river" - Dubai (only)
- "lake,plains,river" - Siem Reap, Raleigh (2 towns)
- "mountain,plains" - Chiang Mai (only)

**Assessment:** 🟢 These are likely valid unique combinations, not typos. Different locations have different features.

**Vegetation Types (6 rare combinations):**
- "tropical,palm trees,mangroves,rainforest" - Bubaque (only)
- "mediterranean,subtropical" - Funchal/Madeira (only)
- "forest,tropical" - Kigali (only)

**Assessment:** 🟢 Valid - unique climates deserve unique descriptions.

### E. Distance to Ocean Anomalies

**Issue:** Found 109 towns listed as ">1000km from ocean" but many are actually coastal.

**Examples of Errors:**
| Town | Listed Distance | Actual Status | Error? |
|------|----------------|---------------|--------|
| Ostuni, Italy | 8km | Coastal features noted | ❓ Mismatch |
| Haarlem, Netherlands | 7km | Close to coast | ❓ Mismatch |
| Bergen (NH), Netherlands | 5km | Coastal features noted | ❓ Mismatch |
| Kampot, Cambodia | 5km | Coastal features noted | ❓ Mismatch |
| Edinburgh, UK | 2km | Near coast | ❓ Mismatch |
| Charlottetown, Canada | 2km | Island location | ❓ Mismatch |

**Assessment:** 🔴 **DATA QUALITY ISSUE** - The query filtered for >1000km but included towns with much smaller distances. The `distance_to_ocean_km` column may have incorrect values.

**Recommendation:** Audit ALL distance_to_ocean_km values against geographic_features_actual. Coastal towns should have distances <50km.

## Recommended Actions

### Priority 1 (Immediate - Data Accuracy)
1. ✅ **Fix Canadian healthcare costs** (20 towns) - Set to ~$75/month
2. ✅ **Review distance_to_ocean_km accuracy** - Verify against geographic features
3. ✅ **Remove placeholder text** from production columns (4 instances)

### Priority 2 (Data Completeness)
1. 🗑️ **Drop 20 completely empty columns** (100% missing)
2. 🗑️ **Drop 2 nearly empty columns** (96.6% missing): image_url_2, image_photographer
3. 📊 **Decide on 30+ partially empty columns** (70-94% missing) - populate or remove

### Priority 3 (Data Quality Improvements)
1. 🎯 **Improve quality_of_life granularity** - Too many 8s and 9s (97% of data)
2. 🔍 **Review duplicate cost values** - 30 towns with identical $2,793/month cost
3. 📏 **Add population_type field** - Distinguish town vs metro area populations
4. 🏷️ **Document estimate vs actual** - Flag round numbers as estimates

### Priority 4 (Schema Cleanup)
1. 📝 **Add data_quality_flags column** - Track which fields are estimates
2. 📅 **Add last_verified_date per field** - Track data freshness (currently 94% missing)
3. 🔄 **Standardize terminology** - "fall" vs "autumn", consistent across all descriptions

## SQL Fixes

### Fix 1: Canadian Healthcare Costs
```sql
-- Update Canadian towns with realistic healthcare costs
UPDATE towns
SET healthcare_cost_monthly = 75,
    healthcare_cost = 75
WHERE country = 'Canada'
  AND (healthcare_cost_monthly = 0 OR healthcare_cost_monthly IS NULL);
```

### Fix 2: Drop Empty Columns (100% missing)
```sql
-- WARNING: Verify in production before running
ALTER TABLE towns
  DROP COLUMN image_url_3,
  DROP COLUMN image_urls,
  DROP COLUMN expat_groups,
  DROP COLUMN international_flights_direct,
  DROP COLUMN regional_airport_distance,
  DROP COLUMN international_airport_distance,
  DROP COLUMN internet_reliability,
  DROP COLUMN mobile_coverage,
  DROP COLUMN bike_infrastructure,
  DROP COLUMN road_quality,
  DROP COLUMN traffic_congestion,
  DROP COLUMN parking_availability,
  DROP COLUMN banking_infrastructure,
  DROP COLUMN digital_services_availability,
  DROP COLUMN sports_facilities,
  DROP COLUMN mountain_activities,
  DROP COLUMN water_sports_available,
  DROP COLUMN cultural_activities,
  DROP COLUMN nearest_major_city,
  DROP COLUMN timezone;
```

### Fix 3: Validate Distance to Ocean
```sql
-- Find coastal towns with suspiciously high ocean distance
SELECT name, country, distance_to_ocean_km, geographic_features_actual
FROM towns
WHERE geographic_features_actual LIKE '%coastal%'
  AND distance_to_ocean_km > 50
ORDER BY distance_to_ocean_km DESC;

-- Find towns marked coastal but missing from query
SELECT name, country, distance_to_ocean_km, geographic_features_actual
FROM towns
WHERE geographic_features_actual LIKE '%coastal%'
  AND (distance_to_ocean_km IS NULL OR distance_to_ocean_km < 10)
ORDER BY name;
```
