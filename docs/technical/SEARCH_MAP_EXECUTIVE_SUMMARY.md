## What We Learned

### 1. Modern Search UX (2024)

**Autocomplete:**
- 65% of users prefer autocomplete (Google data)
- Show suggestions after 1-2 chars on mobile, 2-3 on desktop
- 200ms debounce is optimal (300ms+ feels sluggish)
- Limit to 4-5 suggestions at a time

**Multi-Mode Search:**
- By 2024, 50%+ of searches are voice-based
- Support text, location, and future voice search
- Progressive disclosure for advanced filters
- 80% of Airbnb searches use filters (critical for UX)

**Key Statistics:**
- 30% of shoppers use filters (2x more likely to convert)
- Users scan results in <1 minute (Nielsen Norman Group)
- 75% of orgs using AI for customer experience by 2025 (Gartner)

### 2. Map Library Comparison

| Feature | Leaflet | Mapbox | Google Maps |
|---------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Bundle Size** | 42 KB ✅ | 212.6 KB | Variable |
| **Cost** | Free* | Paid tiers | Paid tiers |
| **Mobile** | Excellent | Good | Good |
| **Max Markers** | 50k | 500k+ | Good |
| **3D Support** | Limited | Excellent | Good |
| **Customization** | High | High | Medium |
| **Best For** | 🎯 Scout2Retire | Data-heavy apps | Google ecosystem |

*Hippocratic License - free for most use cases

**Performance Benchmarks:**
- Leaflet: Good up to 50k markers
- Supercluster: Handles 500k markers in 1-2 seconds
- React Leaflet: Struggles beyond 40k objects (use native Leaflet)
- Canvas rendering: Better performance, harder customization

### 3. Location-Based Search Best Practices

**Critical: Never Auto-Geolocate**
- ❌ Damages trust (95% of Americans concerned about data)
- ❌ Violates WCAG 2.0 accessibility standards
- ❌ Jarring and confusing user experience

**Always Use "Use My Location" Button**
- ✅ Sets clear user expectations
- ✅ Builds trust through transparency
- ✅ Accessibility compliant
- ✅ User control over data

**Implementation:**
- Show textual search AND geolocation together (don't separate)
- Display distance in user's preferred units
- Real-time updates as user moves
- Clear privacy policy

### 4. Responsive Design Essentials

**Breakpoints:**
- 320px: Mobile phones
- 768px: Tablets
- 1024px: Desktop

**Touch Standards:**
- Minimum 44×44px targets (Apple) or 48×48px (Android)
- 8px spacing between targets
- 300ms debounce for touch events

**Standard Gestures:**
- Pinch-to-zoom
- Double-tap for zoom-in
- Two-finger rotation
- Grab-and-drag for panning

**Map Optimization by Device:**
- Mobile: 3-5 critical layers, 60vh height
- Tablet: 5-8 layers, 70vh height
- Desktop: Full complexity, 80vh height

### 5. Accessibility Requirements

**WCAG Compliance:**
- `aria-label` on all search inputs
- `role="status"` for result counts
- `aria-live="polite"` for dynamic updates
- Keyboard navigation (Tab, arrows, Enter, Escape)
- Focus visible on all interactive elements
- 4.5:1 color contrast minimum

**Testing Matrix:**
- ✅ VoiceOver (macOS/iOS)
- ✅ NVDA (Windows)
- ✅ WAVE validation
- ✅ Axe DevTools
- ✅ Keyboard-only navigation

**Map Accessibility (MN IT 2024):**
- Keyboard navigation enabled
- Crosshairs at center for focus
- Logical tab order
- Escape to close popups

### 6. Performance Optimization

**Debounce vs Throttle:**
- **Debounce:** Search inputs, form validation (wait until done)
- **Throttle:** Scroll events, auto-save (limit frequency)
- **Optimal delay:** 200ms for search

**Bundle Size Impact:**
- Leaflet: 42 KB ✅ Minimal impact
- Mapbox: 212.6 KB ⚠️ Significant
- Code splitting can help

**React Optimization:**
- `useMemo` for expensive marker rendering
- `useCallback` for debounced functions
- Cancel in-flight requests
- Viewport culling (only render visible markers)

**Performance Targets:**
- Time to Interactive: < 3.8s
- First Contentful Paint: < 1.8s
- Largest Contentful Paint: < 2.5s

### 7. Real-World Examples

**Airbnb (2024 Innovations):**
- AI-powered natural language search (in development)
- "Search when I move the map" (highly valuable)
- 80% of searches use filters (critical insight)
- Personalized recommendations
- Consistent mobile/desktop experience

**Booking.com:**
- Review scores as filtering option
- Star ratings prominently displayed
- Social proof integrated into search

**Key Lessons:**
- Map integration in search results is table stakes
- Filter design directly impacts conversions
- Personalization increases engagement
- Cross-platform consistency is critical

## Critical Implementation Notes

### ⚠️ Must Remember

1. **NEVER `SELECT *` from towns** (170 columns!)
   - Use `COLUMN_SETS` from `townColumnSets.js`
   - mapView: 6 columns (id, name, country, lat, lng, score)
   - searchResults: ~12 columns
   - autocomplete: 4 columns

2. **ALWAYS use case-insensitive comparisons**
   - Use `.ilike()` not `.eq()`
   - Lesson from 40-hour case sensitivity bug

3. **User-initiated location only**
   - Button, never auto-detect
   - Explicit consent required

4. **200ms debounce for search**
   - Not 100ms (too many requests)
   - Not 300ms+ (feels sluggish)

5. **Minimum 44×44px touch targets**
   - Apple standard
   - Android uses 48×48px
