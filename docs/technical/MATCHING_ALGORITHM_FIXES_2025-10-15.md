# üéØ Matching Algorithm Fixes - October 15, 2025

## Executive Summary

Fixed two critical issues where user preferences were effectively ignored due to dilution in the weighted scoring system. Both issues had the same root cause: important preferences contributing too little to final scores.

---

## Issue #1: Geography Preferences (Shabnam's Problem)

### The Problem
**Shabnam selected "Canada" but saw mostly non-Canadian results**

**Root Cause:**
```
Region category weight: 20%
Country match: 40/90 points = 44% region score
Final contribution: 44% √ó 20% = 8.8%

Other categories (no preferences): 80% √ó 100% = 80%

Result:
- Canadian town: 88.8% total score
- Non-Canadian town: 80% total score
- Difference: 8.8% ‚ùå NOT ENOUGH!
```

### The Fix

**Two-part solution:**

1. **Increased region weight:** 20% ‚Üí 30%
2. **Boosted country match:** 40/90 points ‚Üí 90/90 points (100% region score)

**New math:**
```
Region: 30% √ó 100% = 30%
Other: 70% √ó 100% = 70%

Result:
- Canadian town: 100% total score
- Non-Canadian town: 70% total score  
- Difference: 30% ‚úÖ MUCH BETTER!
```

**Expected Results:**
- Top 20 results: ~80-85% Canadian towns
- Exceptional non-Canadian towns still appear (discovery preserved)

**Category Weight Changes:**
```
Before:
region: 20%, climate: 15%, culture: 15%, hobbies: 10%, admin: 20%, cost: 20%

After:
region: 30%, climate: 13%, culture: 12%, hobbies: 8%, admin: 18%, cost: 19%
```

## Issue #2: Budget Preferences (Universal Problem)

### The Problem
**Budget preferences created almost NO differentiation**

**Example: User with $3000 budget:**
```
Town costs $1500 (HALF budget): 90% score
Town costs $4000 (33% OVER budget): 84.3% score
Difference: 5.7% ‚ùå MEANINGLESS!
```

**Root Cause:**
```
Most users only set total monthly budget ($3000)
Don't set rent budget separately
Don't set healthcare budget separately

Scoring breakdown:
- Overall budget: 40 points (max)
- Rent: 0 points (not set)
- Healthcare: 0 points (not set)
- Tax: 7.5 points (neutral)
= 47.5% cost score (even with PERFECT budget fit!)

Final contribution: 47.5% √ó 19% = 9%
Other categories: 81% √ó 100% = 81%

Budget barely matters!
```

### The Fix

**ADAPTIVE SCORING** - Algorithm detects which fields user actually set:

**Simple User (only total budget - MOST COMMON):**
```javascript
Overall budget: 85 points (was 40)
Tax: 15 points
Max possible: 100%
```

**Power User (all 3 budget fields set):**
```javascript
Overall budget: 40 points (unchanged)
Rent budget: 30 points
Healthcare budget: 20 points
Tax: 15 points
Max possible: 105 (capped at 100)
```

**Scoring Scale (Simple User):**
| Budget Ratio | Points | Description |
|--------------|--------|-------------|
| ‚â•2.0x | 85 | Excellent value |
| ‚â•1.5x | 75 | Comfortable margin |
| ‚â•1.2x | 65 | Good fit |
| ‚â•1.0x | 55 | Adequate |
| ‚â•0.9x | 40 | Slightly tight |
| ‚â•0.8x | 25 | Challenging |
| ‚â•0.7x | 12 | Very tight |
| <0.7x | 5 | Over budget |

**New Results (User with $3000 budget):**
```
$1500 town (HALF): 98.6% total (was 90%)
$3000 town (EXACT): 92.9% total (was 87.2%)
$4000 town (33% OVER): 84.7% total (was 84.3%)

Spread: 13.9% (was 5.7%) ‚úÖ 142% improvement!
```

## Low-Budget User Verification

**Critical Test: Does this fuck $2000 budget users?**

**Answer: NO! They're treated fairly:**

### $2000/month Budget User Results:
| Town Cost | Ratio | Score | Result |
|-----------|-------|-------|--------|
| $665 | 3.0x | 98.6% | Excellent! |
| $980 | 2.0x | 98.6% | Excellent! |
| $1250 | 1.6x | 96.7% | Great! |
| $1500 | 1.3x | 94.8% | Good! |
| $2000 | 1.0x | 92.9% | Adequate |
| $2300 | 0.87x | 87.2% | Challenging |

**Spread: 15.2%** - Very meaningful!

**Key Points:**
1. ‚úÖ Low-budget users see PLENTY of high-scoring affordable towns
2. ‚úÖ Cheap towns ($665-$980) score 98.6% for BOTH $2000 and $3000 users
3. ‚úÖ Ratio-based scoring is fair to all budget levels
4. ‚úÖ Over-budget towns honestly scored as challenging

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:

**1. src/utils/scoring/config.js**
- Changed `CATEGORY_WEIGHTS.region`: 20 ‚Üí 30
- Adjusted other weights proportionally
- Changed `REGION_SETTINGS.EXACT_COUNTRY_MATCH`: 40 ‚Üí 90

**2. src/utils/scoring/categories/regionScoring.js**
- Updated to use `REGION_SETTINGS` constants
- Updated documentation

**3. src/utils/scoring/categories/costScoring.js**
- Added adaptive scoring logic
- Detects which budget fields are set
- Adjusts point distribution accordingly

## Key Learnings

### The Dilution Problem

Both issues stemmed from the same mathematical reality:

**When a category has:**
- Low weight in final score (e.g., 20%)
- Incomplete data from user (e.g., only 40/90 points possible)
- Other categories getting 100% for "no preference"

**Result:** User's actual preference barely matters!

**Solution Pattern:**
1. Increase category weight if it's important (region: 20% ‚Üí 30%)
2. Make single-field entries worth more (budget: 40 ‚Üí 85 points)
3. Adapt scoring based on what user actually sets

### Universal Principle

**For any preference category to be meaningful:**
```
Category_Impact = Category_Weight √ó Category_Score √ó (1 - Other_Categories_Default)

If Category_Impact < 10% of final score:
  ‚Üí User won't see preference reflected in results
  ‚Üí Feels like algorithm ignores them
  ‚Üí Bad UX!
```

**Our fixes ensure minimum 13-30% impact for primary preferences.**

## Future Considerations

### Potential Improvements:

1. **Climate preferences** might have similar dilution issue
   - Currently: 13% weight
   - Need to verify if spread is meaningful

2. **Combined preferences** (e.g., "Canada + $2000 budget")
   - Both filters compound: 30% + 13.9% = meaningful
   - Should work well

3. **Monitoring needed:**
   - Track actual user results
   - Measure if users find what they want
   - Adjust weights if needed

### Warning Signs:
- Users complaining "I set X but got Y"
- Preference categories showing <10% score spread
- High-scoring towns ignoring user's explicit selections
