## üéØ WHY NATURAL QUESTIONS WITH CONTEXT REQUEST?

### Before (Keyword Format):
```
Bubaque Guinea-Bissau healthcare score 0.0-10.0
```
‚ùå Google sees: Random keywords, unclear intent
‚ùå Results: Generic articles about healthcare systems

### After (Natural Question Format with Context):
```
what is Bubaque, Guinea-Bissau healthcare score on a scale from 0.0-10.0? Provide additional context, in no more than three sentences.
```
‚úÖ Google sees: Clear question with specific parameters + context request
‚úÖ Results: Direct answers PLUS explanatory context
‚úÖ Google AI provides numeric value + brief explanation
‚úÖ Featured snippets with context (not just numbers)
‚úÖ AI Overviews triggered more often

## üìã QUERY PATTERNS BY FIELD TYPE

### 1. **SCORE/RATING FIELDS** (with range)

**Pattern**: `what is {location} {field_name} on a scale from {range}? Provide additional context, in no more than three sentences.`

**Examples**:
- Healthcare Score (0-10): `what is Bubaque, Guinea-Bissau healthcare score on a scale from 0.0-10.0? Provide additional context, in no more than three sentences.`
- Safety Score (0-10): `what is Sal, Cape Verde safety score on a scale from 0.0-10.0? Provide additional context, in no more than three sentences.`
- Walkability (0-100): `what is Valencia, Spain walkability score on a scale from 0-100? Provide additional context, in no more than three sentences.`
- Government Efficiency (1-5): `what is Lisbon, Portugal government efficiency rating on a scale from 1-5? Provide additional context, in no more than three sentences.`

**Why it works**:
- Google AI understands "on a scale from X to Y"
- Featured snippets often show exact scores
- Context request triggers AI Overviews with explanations
- Can extract from comparison websites, reviews

---

### 2. **DISTANCE FIELDS** (with unit: km)

**Pattern**: `how far is the nearest {place_type} from {location} in km?`

**Examples**:
- Regional Airport: `how far is the nearest domestic airport from Bubaque, Guinea-Bissau in km?`
- International Airport: `how far is the nearest international airport from Sal, Cape Verde in km?`
- Hospital: `how far is the nearest major hospital from Valencia, Spain in km?`
- Generic Airport: `how far is the nearest airport from Lisbon, Portugal in km?`

**Why it works**:
- "how far" triggers distance-specific results
- "in km" ensures metric units (not miles)
- Google Maps often provides direct answers
- Featured snippets show exact distances

---

### 3. **COUNT FIELDS**

**Pattern**: `how many {item_type} are in {location}?`

**Examples**:
- Hospital Count: `how many hospitals are in Bubaque, Guinea-Bissau?`
- School Count: `how many schools are in Sal, Cape Verde?`
- Restaurant Count: `how many restaurants are in Valencia, Spain?`

**Why it works**:
- "how many" triggers count/quantity results
- Google often shows exact numbers
- Can pull from tourism sites, government data

---

### 4. **BOOLEAN FIELDS** (yes/no)

**Pattern**: `does {location} have {feature}?` or `is {feature} available in {location}?`

**Examples**:
- Retirement Visa: `does Bubaque, Guinea-Bissau have retirement visa available?`
- English Doctors: `are there English speaking doctors in Sal, Cape Verde?`
- Tax Treaty: `does Valencia, Spain have a tax treaty with the US?`
- Tax Haven: `is Lisbon, Portugal a tax haven?`

**Why it works**:
- Yes/no questions get direct answers
- Featured snippets often say "Yes" or "No"
- Google AI extracts boolean answers well

---

### 5. **AIR QUALITY INDEX**

**Pattern**: `what is the air quality index (AQI) in {location}?`

**Examples**:
- `what is the air quality index (AQI) in Bubaque, Guinea-Bissau?`
- `what is the air quality index (AQI) in Valencia, Spain?`

**Why it works**:
- "AQI" is standardized term
- Google shows real-time AQI data
- Featured snippets with current readings

---

### 6. **QUALITY FIELDS**

**Pattern**: `what is the {quality_type} in {location}?`

**Examples**:
- Emergency Services: `what is the emergency services quality in Bubaque, Guinea-Bissau?`
- Healthcare Cost: `what is the healthcare cost in Valencia, Spain?`

**Why it works**:
- "what is" gets descriptive answers
- Can extract from expat forums, travel guides

---

### 7. **DEFAULT FIELDS** (fallback)

**Pattern**: `what is {location} {field_name}?`

**Examples**:
- Crime Rate: `what is Lisbon, Portugal crime rate?`
- Political Stability: `what is Valencia, Spain political stability?`

**Why it works**:
- Simple, clear question format
- Google understands intent
- Gets general information

## üé® TEMPLATE SYSTEM

### How Templates Work:

When user checks **"Reuse this query pattern for other towns"**, we save:

**Original Query** (Bubaque):
```
what is Bubaque, Guinea-Bissau healthcare score on a scale from 0.0-10.0?
```

**Saved Template**:
```
what is {town}, {country} healthcare score on a scale from 0.0-10.0?
```

**Applied to Sal, Cape Verde**:
```
what is Sal, Cape Verde healthcare score on a scale from 0.0-10.0?
```

**Applied to Valencia, Spain**:
```
what is Valencia, Spain healthcare score on a scale from 0.0-10.0?
```

### Template Placeholders:
- `{town}` - Replaced with actual town name
- `{country}` - Replaced with actual country name

### Template Storage:
- **Location**: localStorage (browser)
- **Key**: `searchQueryTemplates`
- **Format**: JSON object `{ fieldName: templateString }`

**Example localStorage**:
```json
{
  "healthcare_score": "what is {town}, {country} healthcare score on a scale from 0.0-10.0?",
  "regional_airport_distance": "how far is the nearest domestic airport from {town}, {country} in km?",
  "hospital_count": "how many hospitals are in {town}, {country}?"
}
```

## üîß IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Function: `generateSmartQuery()`

**Location**: `/src/components/EditableDataField.jsx` (line 175)

**Logic Flow**:
1. Check field type (distance, count, score, boolean, etc.)
2. Build appropriate question format
3. Include location: `{townName}, {countryName}`
4. Include units (km, AQI, etc.)
5. Include ranges (0-10, 0-100, etc.)
6. Return natural question string

**Example Code**:
```javascript
if (labelLower.includes('score') || labelLower.includes('rating')) {
  if (range && typeof range === 'string') {
    query = `what is ${location} ${label.toLowerCase()} on a scale from ${range}?`;
  } else {
    query = `what is ${location} ${label.toLowerCase()}?`;
  }
}
```

## üéì LESSONS LEARNED

### What Works:
- ‚úÖ Natural questions >>> Keyword searches
- ‚úÖ Including units (km, %, AQI) >>> Vague queries
- ‚úÖ Including ranges (0-10, 0-100) >>> No context
- ‚úÖ Specific place types ("domestic airport" vs "airport")
- ‚úÖ Comma in location ("Valencia, Spain" vs "Valencia Spain")

### What Doesn't Work:
- ‚ùå Too many keywords (Google gets confused)
- ‚ùå Special characters (quotes, parentheses break results)
- ‚ùå ALL CAPS (looks spammy)
- ‚ùå Multiple questions in one query

### Google AI Loves:
- ‚úÖ "what is"
- ‚úÖ "how far"
- ‚úÖ "how many"
- ‚úÖ "does {X} have {Y}"
- ‚úÖ "on a scale from X to Y"
- ‚úÖ "in km" / "in meters"

**Pro Tip**: When user refines a query and saves as template, they're creating a reusable pattern for ALL 343+ towns. This is the key to data normalization!
