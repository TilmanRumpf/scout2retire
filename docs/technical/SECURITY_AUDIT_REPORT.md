# Security Audit Report: Onboarding Bypass Analysis

## Executive Summary

This security audit examined whether users can bypass onboarding requirements and access restricted features in Scout2Retire. The findings reveal **significant security vulnerabilities** that allow users to bypass onboarding completely.

## Critical Findings

### 1. **Frontend Allows Bypassing Onboarding (CRITICAL)**

In `src/App.jsx` (lines 116-119), there is an explicit comment revealing the security vulnerability:

```javascript
// Note: Users can abandon onboarding at any time and navigate to other pages
// This respects user choice to not share personal data
// Only suggest onboarding, don't force it
// Users who completed onboarding can still access their preferences to edit them
```

**Impact**: Users with `onboarding_completed = false` can freely navigate to any protected route, including:
- Daily discovery page
- Favorites
- Journal
- Schedule
- Chat
- All other features

### 2. **No Backend RLS Protection for Onboarding Status (HIGH)**

The Row Level Security (RLS) policies do NOT check `onboarding_completed` status:

#### Favorites Table:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own favorites" ON favorites
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

#### Journal Entries Table:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage own journal_entries" ON journal_entries 
    USING ((auth.uid() = user_id));
```

**Impact**: Any authenticated user can create favorites, journal entries, and other content regardless of onboarding status.

### 3. **Missing Security Checks**

No tables have RLS policies that verify `onboarding_completed = true` before allowing operations. This means:
- Users can save favorites without completing onboarding
- Users can create journal entries without completing onboarding
- Users can schedule visits without completing onboarding
- Users can send chat messages without completing onboarding

## Current Data Analysis

While examining the current database:
- All existing users have `onboarding_completed = true`
- No evidence of current exploitation
- However, the vulnerability exists and can be exploited

## Security Vulnerabilities Summary

1. **Frontend Protection**: None - users can navigate anywhere
2. **Backend Protection**: None - RLS policies don't check onboarding status
3. **API Protection**: Unknown - needs further investigation
4. **Data Integrity**: At risk - incomplete user profiles can interact with all features

## Recommended Security Fixes

### 1. Backend RLS Policy Updates (URGENT)

Add onboarding checks to all user-activity tables:

```sql
-- Example for favorites table
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own favorites" ON favorites
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
        auth.uid() = user_id 
        AND EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM users 
            WHERE id = auth.uid() 
            AND onboarding_completed = true
        )
    );
```

### 2. Frontend Route Protection

Implement proper route guards that check onboarding status:

```javascript
const RequireOnboarding = ({ children }) => {
    const { user, onboardingCompleted } = useAuth();
    
    if (!onboardingCompleted) {
        return <Navigate to="/onboarding/progress" replace />;
    }
    
    return children;
};
```

### 3. API Middleware

Add server-side checks in API endpoints to verify onboarding completion before allowing operations.

## Risk Assessment

- **Likelihood**: HIGH - The vulnerability is easily exploitable
- **Impact**: MEDIUM - Users can access features without providing preference data
- **Overall Risk**: HIGH - Core application logic can be bypassed

## Conclusion

The application currently has no effective protection against users bypassing onboarding. Both frontend and backend allow unrestricted access to all features regardless of onboarding status. This violates the assumed user flow and could result in:

1. Poor user experience (no personalized recommendations)
2. Incomplete user data
3. Potential system errors when algorithms expect onboarding data
4. Security compliance issues

The vulnerability should be addressed immediately by implementing both frontend and backend protections.
