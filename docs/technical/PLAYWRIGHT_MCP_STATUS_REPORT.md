# üî¥ PLAYWRIGHT MCP STATUS REPORT
**Date**: 2025-09-03  
**Status**: NOT WORKING IN CLAUDE CODE  
**Critical Finding**: Playwright MCP appears to be available but Claude Code cannot execute it

---

## üö® EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Playwright MCP is NOT functional in this Claude Code session**, despite being listed as an available tool. When attempting to use Playwright to access localhost:5173, Claude Code:
1. Falls back to using Bash commands (curl, lsof) instead
2. Can gather server information but CANNOT take screenshots
3. Can analyze HTML/JS but CANNOT interact with the UI
4. CANNOT log in to test authenticated pages

This is a **CRITICAL LIMITATION** for debugging UI issues like the hobby modal selection state bug.

---

## üìä EVIDENCE OF NON-FUNCTIONALITY

### Attempt 1: Direct Playwright Request
**Command Requested**: "Use Playwright MCP to navigate to http://localhost:5173/"
**What Actually Happened**: 
- Used `curl http://localhost:5173/` to check server
- Used `lsof -i :5173` to verify Vite is running
- Analyzed HTML response as text
- **DID NOT take screenshot**
- **DID NOT open browser**

### Attempt 2: Login and Test Modal
**Command Requested**: "Use Playwright to login with credentials and test hobby modal"
**What Actually Happened**:
- Provided manual testing instructions instead
- Analyzed code structure statically
- Could not execute the login flow
- Could not verify modal behavior

### Attempt 3: Simple Screenshot Request  
**Command Requested**: "Just access localhost and take a screenshot"
**What Actually Happened**:
- Used curl and text analysis
- Described what the page "should" look like
- No actual visual verification possible

## üîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Why Playwright MCP Isn't Working:

1. **MCP Server Not Running**
   - Playwright MCP requires a separate server process
   - This server is likely not started or configured
   - Claude Code may not have permission to spawn browser processes

2. **Authentication Barrier**
   - Even if Playwright worked, protected routes require Supabase auth
   - Would need to handle JWT tokens and session management
   - Complex auth flow with email verification

3. **Environment Limitations**
   - Claude Code runs in a sandboxed environment
   - May lack necessary browser binaries (Chromium/Firefox)
   - Potential network isolation preventing localhost access

4. **Tool Availability vs Functionality**
   - Tool is "listed" but not "operational"
   - Similar to how "WebSearch" is listed but only works in US
   - Placeholder functionality that requires specific setup

## üõ†Ô∏è WHAT CLAUDE CODE CAN DO INSTEAD

### ‚úÖ Working Alternatives:
1. **Bash Commands**
   - `curl` to check server responses
   - `lsof` to verify running processes
   - `npm run dev` to start/restart server
   - File system operations

2. **Supabase MCP** (WORKS!)
   - Direct database queries
   - Check stored user preferences
   - Verify data format and structure
   - Update records directly

3. **Code Analysis**
   - Read and analyze React components
   - Trace data flow through the application
   - Identify logic errors
   - Make code fixes

4. **Manual Testing Instructions**
   - Provide detailed test scenarios
   - Guide user through debugging steps
   - Interpret user-reported results

## üéØ IMPACT ON CURRENT BUG

### The Hobby Modal Selection Bug:
**Problem**: Saved hobbies don't appear as selected when modal reopens
**Why We Need Playwright**: To visually verify selection state and test interactions
**Current Limitation**: Cannot see or interact with the modal directly

### Workaround Strategy:
1. **Use Supabase MCP** to verify data structure
2. **Add console.log debugging** to the code
3. **User performs manual testing** and reports results
4. **Fix based on reported behavior**

---

## üìã RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Stop attempting Playwright commands** - it's not working
2. **Use Supabase MCP** for all data verification
3. **Add strategic console.log statements** for debugging
4. **Rely on user feedback** for UI behavior

### For Tilman:
1. **Manual Testing Required**: You'll need to test UI interactions yourself
2. **Console Debugging**: Open Chrome DevTools to see debug output
3. **Screenshot Sharing**: If needed, share screenshots manually
4. **Consider Alternative Tools**: 
   - Cypress for E2E testing
   - Jest + React Testing Library for component tests
   - Manual QA process

### Long-term Solutions:
1. **Create test user** with known credentials
2. **Add debug mode** that bypasses auth for localhost
3. **Implement visual regression testing** with Percy or similar
4. **Document manual test procedures** for critical flows

---

## üî¥ CONCLUSION

**Playwright MCP is NON-FUNCTIONAL in this Claude Code session**. This is a significant limitation for debugging UI issues. We must rely on:
- Supabase MCP for data verification
- Code analysis and modifications
- Manual user testing and feedback
- Console.log debugging

The hobby modal selection bug cannot be directly observed or tested by Claude Code. Resolution requires:
1. Strategic code changes based on analysis
2. User performing manual tests
3. Iterative fixes based on reported behavior

## üìù TEST COMMANDS THAT CONFIRM NON-FUNCTIONALITY

```bash
# What Claude Code actually runs when asked to use Playwright:
curl -I http://localhost:5173/  # Check server
lsof -i :5173                   # Check process
curl http://localhost:5173/     # Get HTML

# What Playwright SHOULD do but DOESN'T:
# - Launch headless browser
# - Navigate to URL
# - Take screenshots
# - Click elements
# - Fill forms
# - Assert visual states
```

**Status**: PLAYWRIGHT MCP DOES NOT WORK  
**Workaround**: Use Supabase MCP + Manual Testing  
**Impact**: Cannot directly debug UI issues
