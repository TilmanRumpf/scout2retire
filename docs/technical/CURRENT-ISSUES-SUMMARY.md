# Current Issues Summary - Scout2Retire

## üî¥ Critical Issues Found

### 1. **Database Missing Partner Columns**
**Status**: ‚ùå NOT FIXED
**Impact**: Partner citizenship data cannot be saved

The database is missing the partner citizenship columns. This is why partner data isn't persisting.

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**
Execute this SQL in Supabase Dashboard:
```sql
ALTER TABLE user_preferences
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS partner_primary_citizenship TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS partner_secondary_citizenship TEXT;
```

### 2. **Family Status is NULL in Database**
**Current Data for ctorres@asshole.com:**
- family_status: null (should be "couple")
- primary_citizenship: us ‚úÖ
- secondary_citizenship: null ‚úÖ
- partner_primary_citizenship: undefined ‚ùå (column doesn't exist)
- partner_secondary_citizenship: undefined ‚ùå (column doesn't exist)

### 3. **Data Still in Old Table**
The old `onboarding_responses` table contains:
- family_situation: "couple"
- User has dual citizenship (US/DE)
- Partner has dual citizenship (US/CA)

This data needs to be migrated after adding the columns.

## üìã Steps to Fix (In Order)

### Step 1: Add Missing Columns
```sql
ALTER TABLE user_preferences
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS partner_primary_citizenship TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS partner_secondary_citizenship TEXT;
```

### Step 2: Run Migration
After adding columns, run:
```bash
node migrate-family-citizenship-data.js
```

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment
The latest code with fixes was pushed at [time]. Vercel deployment typically takes 1-2 minutes.

### Step 4: Test
1. Clear browser cache
2. Login as ctorres@asshole.com
3. Go to onboarding/current-status
4. Verify:
   - Family situation shows "Couple"
   - User citizenship shows US (primary) with dual citizenship checkbox
   - Partner citizenship fields are visible
   - Data persists after logout/login

## üé® Layout Issue (localhost)

The layout issue in localhost might be due to:
1. CSS not loading properly
2. Tailwind compilation issues
3. Browser cache

**Try:**
1. Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Restart dev server:
   ```bash
   # Kill the current process
   lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9
   # Restart
   npm run dev
   ```

## üåç Different Universes Explanation

You're seeing different things because:

1. **Production (scout2retire.vercel.app)**:
   - May not have latest code deployed yet
   - Database is missing partner columns
   - Migration hasn't been run

2. **Local (localhost:5173)**:
   - Has latest code
   - But database is same (missing columns)
   - May have CSS/build issues

Both environments are using the SAME database, which is missing the partner columns. This is why neither environment can save partner data properly.

## ‚úÖ Once Everything is Fixed

You should see:
- Family situation persists as "Couple"
- User citizenship persists (including dual)
- Partner citizenship persists (including dual)
- Layout looks normal in both environments
