# üü¢ RECOVERY CHECKPOINT - [DATE: YYYY-MM-DD, TIME: HH:MM AM/PM]
## SYSTEM STATE: [WORKING/PARTIAL/BROKEN]

### ‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING
- [ ] User authentication and login system
- [ ] Town discovery page with filtering
- [ ] Daily town recommendations
- [ ] Matching algorithm scoring (Current status: __________)
- [ ] Favorites functionality  
- [ ] User preferences/onboarding
- [ ] Database connections
- [ ] Image loading and optimization
- [ ] Responsive design on mobile/desktop
- [ ] [Add any other working features]

### üîß RECENT CHANGES (Since Last Checkpoint)
```
File: src/utils/matchingAlgorithm.js
Lines: 127-129
Change: Added geographic_features_actual, vegetation_type_actual to SELECT
Reason: Fields were missing, causing null values in scoring

File: [next file]
Lines: [line numbers]
Change: [exact change]
Reason: [why]
```

### üìä DATABASE STATE
- **Snapshot Path:** `database-snapshots/[TIMESTAMP]/`
- **Snapshot Command Used:** `node create-database-snapshot.js`
- **Tables Backed Up:**
  - users: [X] records
  - towns: [X] records (Note: all have geographic_features_actual populated)
  - user_preferences: [X] records
  - favorites: [X] records
  - [other tables]
- **Data Integrity:**
  - All towns have geographic data: YES/NO
  - All users have preferences: YES/NO

### üéØ WHAT WAS ACHIEVED (BE EXTREMELY DETAILED)
1. **Primary Achievement:**
   - [Detailed description of main accomplishment]
   - Before: [How it was broken]
   - After: [How it works now]
   - Impact: [Who/what this affects]

### üîç HOW TO VERIFY IT'S WORKING
1. **Basic Smoke Test:**
   ```
   1. Open http://localhost:5173/
   2. Log in with test account
   3. Navigate to Discovery page
   4. Check that Spanish towns show varied scores (not all 44%)
   5. [Add more steps]
   ```

2. **Specific Feature Tests:**
   - **Matching Algorithm:** 
     - Select Spain + Coastal in preferences
     - Valencia should score 80-100%
     - Inland towns should score lower
   - **[Feature 2]:**
     - [Test steps]
     - [Expected result]

3. **Edge Cases to Verify:**
   - [ ] New user with no preferences
   - [ ] User with all preferences selected
   - [ ] Empty search results
   - [ ] [Other edge cases]

### ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN ISSUES & LIMITATIONS
- **Issue 1:** [Description]
  - Severity: [High/Medium/Low]

### üîÑ HOW TO ROLLBACK TO THIS CHECKPOINT

#### Quick Rollback (if something breaks):
```bash
# 1. Stop current dev server (Ctrl+C)

# 2. Restore database to this checkpoint
node restore-database-snapshot.js [TIMESTAMP]

# 3. Reset code to this commit
git reset --hard [COMMIT_HASH]

# 4. Restart dev server
npm run dev

# 5. Verify restoration worked
# Check http://localhost:5173/ shows expected state
```

#### Selective Rollback (just database or just code):
```bash
# Just database:
node restore-database-snapshot.js [TIMESTAMP]

# Just code:
git checkout [COMMIT_HASH] -- src/
```

## REMEMBER: 
This checkpoint exists because we lost 40 hours not having proper recovery points.
ALWAYS create these when:
- Fixing a major bug
- Before making risky changes  
- After achieving something significant
- Before any deployment
- When user requests "safe return point" or "git push"
