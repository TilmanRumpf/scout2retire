# 🟢 RECOVERY CHECKPOINT - August 28, 2025 22:44
## SYSTEM STATE: WORKING - Planning Stage Complete

### ✅ WHAT'S WORKING
- All 341 towns loading and displaying correctly
- User authentication and login functioning
- Onboarding flow operational with all preference options
- Town matching algorithm producing scores (though case-sensitive issues exist)
- Search and filtering features working
- Dev server stable on localhost:5173
- Database connections healthy

### 🔧 RECENT CHANGES
- Created Master Cleanup Plan V4.0 → V5.0 evolution
- Conducted comprehensive multi-agent audit
- Identified 14 critical safety issues in original plan
- Fixed all identified issues in V5.0
- Added pre-flight safety checks (Phase 0)
- Implemented live execution tracker
- Enhanced rollback procedures

### 📊 DATABASE STATE  
- Snapshot: database-snapshots/2025-08-28T22-43-55
- Users: 12 records
- Towns: 341 records  
- User preferences: 12 records
- Favorites: 27 records
- All data intact and unchanged (planning phase only)

### 🎯 WHAT WAS ACHIEVED
- **Comprehensive Audit Complete**: Used 4 specialized agents to review SQL, JavaScript, Security, and UI consistency
- **Critical Issues Identified**: Found transaction safety violations, missing concurrent access protection, incomplete VALUE_LABEL_MAPS
- **Solutions Documented**: Created V5.0 plan with all fixes integrated
- **Safety Measures Added**: Production checks, maintenance mode, table locking, savepoints
- **Execution Ready**: Rock-solid step-by-step procedure with live tracking

### 🔍 HOW TO VERIFY IT'S WORKING
1. Check dev server: `curl http://localhost:5173` should return HTML
2. Verify database: All 341 towns should be present
3. Test matching: Spain towns still showing ~44% scores (known issue to be fixed)
4. Review plan: `/docs/cleanup/Master_Cleanup_Plan_V5_AUDITED_Aug_28_2025.md` contains complete procedure

### ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES
- Case sensitivity causing low matching scores (44% for Spain)
- Mixed case data in database (some "Plains" vs "coastal")
- Duplicate values in user preferences arrays
- Geographic features mismatch between UI and database

### 🔄 HOW TO ROLLBACK
```bash
# Restore database
node restore-database-snapshot.js 2025-08-28T22-43-55

# Revert git changes
git checkout 67ebe57

# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```
