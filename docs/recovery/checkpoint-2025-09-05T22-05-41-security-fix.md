# üîí RECOVERY CHECKPOINT - 2025-09-05 22:05:41
## SYSTEM STATE: WORKING - SECURITY BREACH RESOLVED

### ‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING
- All Supabase keys rotated and secured
- Frontend application fully functional at localhost:5173
- Database connectivity restored with new secure keys
- All 171 database utility scripts updated to use environment variables
- User authentication and session management operational
- Town search and filtering system working
- Matching algorithms functioning correctly
- Database snapshot and restore utilities operational
- No exposed keys in GitHub repository

### üîß RECENT CHANGES
- **CRITICAL SECURITY FIX**: Rotated all Supabase keys after GitHub exposure
- Updated .env file with new secure keys:
  - New anon key (ends with ...UVCVHs)
  - New service role key (ends with ...Y1uyE)
- Fixed 171 files to use environment variables instead of hardcoded keys:
  - All files in database-utilities/
  - All files in scripts/
  - All files in archive/
  - claude-db-helper.js
  - create-database-snapshot.js
  - restore-database-snapshot.js
- Added dotenv configuration to all database scripts
- Verified old exposed keys are completely deactivated

### üìä DATABASE STATE  
- Snapshot: database-snapshots/2025-09-05T22-05-41
- users: 12 records
- towns: 341 records
- user_preferences: 12 records
- favorites: 26 records
- notifications: 5 records
- All data intact and accessible with new keys

### üéØ WHAT WAS ACHIEVED
- **RESOLVED CRITICAL SECURITY BREACH**: Exposed service role key from GitHub is now dead
- Implemented proper environment variable usage across entire codebase
- Removed all hardcoded sensitive keys from source files
- Established secure key management practices
- Verified application functionality with new keys
- Created automated script for fixing hardcoded keys in future

### üîç HOW TO VERIFY IT'S WORKING
1. Visit http://localhost:5173/ - should load normally
2. Login with any test account - authentication should work
3. Search for towns - database queries should return results
4. Run: `node create-database-snapshot.js` - should create snapshot successfully
5. Run: `node claude-db-helper.js "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM towns"` - should return 341
6. Check that old exposed key is dead: It returns "Invalid API key"

### ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN ISSUES
- Some archive files still contain placeholder text (harmless)
- CLAUDE.md contains redacted keys (intentional)
- 3 tables don't exist yet (shared_towns, invitations, reviews)

### üîÑ HOW TO ROLLBACK
```bash
# Restore database
node restore-database-snapshot.js 2025-09-05T22-05-41

# Revert git changes (WARNING: This will restore exposed keys!)
git reset --hard 7aede4c

# Update .env with current working keys
```

### üîê SECURITY NOTES
- NEVER commit .env file
- .env is in .gitignore (verified)
- All keys now loaded from environment variables
- Old exposed key cannot access database (verified dead)
- New keys expire in 2072 (47 years from now)
