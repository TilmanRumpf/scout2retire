# üü¢ RECOVERY CHECKPOINT - 2025-08-29 21:08 EST
## SYSTEM STATE: WORKING - Hobbies Display Fixed

### ‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING
- **Hobbies Expansion System**: Compound buttons (golf_tennis, water_sports, etc.) correctly expand to individual values
  - Test case: Clicking "Golf & Tennis" saves as ["golf", "tennis", "pickleball", "badminton"]
  - Test case: Clicking "Water Sports" saves as ["swimming", "snorkeling"]
  - Database verification: 0 compound values exist in database (all properly expanded)
  - 12 users have properly expanded values stored
  
- **Display Normalization**: Fixed duplicate display issue in summary
  - BEFORE: "Snorkelling" and "Snorkeling" appeared as duplicates
  - AFTER: All activities normalized to lowercase with underscores, deduplicated in display
  - Modal selections now properly normalized when toggled
  
- **UI Summary Section**: "Your Activities & Preferences" section properly merges and deduplicates
  - Activities and custom_physical merged with Set deduplication
  - Interests and custom_hobbies merged with Set deduplication
  - Display values properly formatted with correct capitalization
  
- **Database Integrity**: All user preferences properly stored
  - 12 users with complete preferences
  - 341 towns with data
  - 27 favorites saved
  - Retirement visa data fixed for 340 towns

### üîß RECENT CHANGES
- **OnboardingHobbies.jsx:623-633**: Modified handleCustomPhysicalToggle
  - Added: `const normalizedActivity = activity.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '_');`
  - Changed toggle logic to use normalizedActivity
  
- **OnboardingHobbies.jsx:635-645**: Modified handleCustomHobbiesToggle
  - Added same normalization as physical activities
  - Ensures consistent storage format
  
- **OnboardingHobbies.jsx:121**: Updated modal selection check
  - Changed to: `formData.custom_physical.includes(activity.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '_'))`
  - Prevents false negatives from case mismatches
  
- **OnboardingHobbies.jsx:905-916**: Fixed summary display
  - Merged activities with custom_physical using Set for deduplication
  - Added: `[...new Set([...formData.activities, ...formData.custom_physical])]`
  - Same fix applied to interests/custom_hobbies section

### üìä DATABASE STATE  
- Snapshot: database-snapshots/2025-08-29T21-08-04
- **users**: 12 records (all with onboarding completed)
- **towns**: 341 records (all with expanded geographic/vegetation data)
- **user_preferences**: 12 records (all with properly expanded hobbies/activities)
- **favorites**: 27 records
- **notifications**: 5 records
- No compound values in any user's activities/interests arrays
- All activities stored as lowercase with underscores

### üéØ WHAT WAS ACHIEVED
- **Fixed Duplicate Display Bug**: User reported "Snorkeling" appearing twice with different spellings
  - Root cause: Modal selections weren't normalized, causing case mismatches
  - Solution: Normalized all inputs to lowercase_with_underscores
  - Result: No more duplicates in "Your Activities & Preferences" summary
  
- **Verified Expansion System**: Confirmed compound buttons properly expand
  - golf_tennis ‚Üí golf, tennis, pickleball, badminton
  - water_sports ‚Üí swimming, snorkeling
  - All 12 users have expanded values, 0 have compound values
  
- **Improved Data Consistency**: All activity/interest values now normalized
  - Prevents future duplicate issues
  - Ensures consistent database storage
  - Makes searching/filtering more reliable

### üîç HOW TO VERIFY IT'S WORKING
1. **Test Hobbies Page**:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:5173/onboarding/hobbies
   - Click "Golf & Tennis" button
   - Open modal and add "Swimming" as custom activity
   - Save and check summary at bottom
   - Expected: No duplicates, all items properly formatted
   
2. **Check Database**:
   ```sql
   SELECT user_id, activities, custom_physical 
   FROM user_preferences 
   WHERE activities IS NOT NULL;
   ```
   - Expected: All values lowercase with underscores
   - No compound values like "golf_tennis"
   
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Try adding "SWIMMING" in modal (should normalize to "swimming")
   - Try adding "Rock Climbing" (should become "rock_climbing")
   - Toggle same activity from both button and modal

### ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN ISSUES
- **Minor**: 3 tables don't exist yet (shared_towns, invitations, reviews) - not critical
- **UI Polish**: Some modal activities might show as selected even if added via compound button
- **Future Enhancement**: Could add validation to prevent duplicate entries at input time

### üîÑ HOW TO ROLLBACK
```bash
# Restore database
node restore-database-snapshot.js 2025-08-29T21-08-04

# Revert git changes
