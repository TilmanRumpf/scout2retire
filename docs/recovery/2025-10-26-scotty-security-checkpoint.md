### üìä DATABASE STATE
- Snapshot: `database-snapshots/2025-10-26T20-02-33`
- Users: 14 records
- Towns: 352 records
- User preferences: 13 records
- Favorites: 31 records
- Scotty conversations: Tables created, ready for data
- Scotty messages: Tables created, ready for data
- Scotty chat usage: Paywall tracking operational

### üéØ WHAT WAS ACHIEVED
1. **Completed Scotty AI Implementation**
   - Designed lean conversation tracking aligned with paywall
   - Built complete database schema with proper indexes
   - Created helper functions for easy integration
   - Implemented topic/town detection for analytics
   - Full conversation history with persistence

2. **Fixed Critical Security Issues**
   - 10 tables had RLS disabled - NOW ENABLED
   - 5 views bypassed RLS with SECURITY DEFINER - NOW FIXED
   - Service role key was in Git history - CLEANED
   - All new Scotty tables have proper RLS from start

3. **Maintained Lean Architecture**
   - Reused existing paywall tracking (`scotty_chat_usage`)
   - Minimal new tables (only 2: conversations & messages)
   - Smart reuse of existing auth/user systems
   - Efficient column sets to avoid SELECT * issues

### üîç HOW TO VERIFY IT'S WORKING
1. **Test Scotty UI**:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to http://localhost:5173/scotty
   # Send message: "What are the best towns in Portugal?"
   # Check conversation saves
   # Refresh page - conversation persists
   # Check history dropdown shows conversation
   ```

2. **Verify Database**:
   ```sql
   -- Check Scotty tables exist
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM scotty_conversations;
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM scotty_messages;

   -- Check RLS is enabled
   SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
   FROM pg_tables
   WHERE schemaname = 'public';
   ```

3. **Test Paywall Limits**:
   ```javascript
   // Check user's limit
   await supabase.rpc('get_scotty_chat_count_current_month')
   // Should return number of chats used this month
   ```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN ISSUES
- Some tables referenced in snapshot script don't exist yet (shared_towns, invitations, reviews)
- No users in database for testing (need to create account via UI)
- Old ScottyGuide.jsx component still exists (can be removed)

### üîÑ HOW TO ROLLBACK
```bash
# Restore database to before changes
node restore-database-snapshot.js 2025-10-26T20-02-33

# Revert Git changes
git reset --hard 7bb45ae  # Last stable commit

# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```
