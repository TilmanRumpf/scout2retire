# üü¢ RECOVERY CHECKPOINT - September 7, 2025 04:02 AM
## SYSTEM STATE: WORKING

### ‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING
- **Favorites Page**: Loads without console errors after fixing syntax issues
- **Hobby Scoring**: Native matches (water sports + coastal) scoring 85-95%
- **Geographic Inference**: Strict matching prevents nonsense scores (Rome ‚â† water destination)
- **User Preferences**: Tilman's account has all 16 water activities properly saved
- **Development Server**: Vite running clean without parse errors
- **Console**: Finally clean after removing all debug console.log statements
- **Database**: All tables intact with proper data

### üîß RECENT CHANGES
- **src/utils/scoring/geographicInference.js (lines 270-352)**: Added native match logic for compound activities
- **src/utils/scoring/helpers/hobbiesMatching.js (lines 205-207)**: Removed debug console.log statements
- **src/utils/scoring/unifiedScoring.js (lines 57, 136-138)**: Fixed orphaned object literals
- **src/utils/scoring/matchingAlgorithm.js**: Removed all console.log debug statements
- **src/utils/scoring/enhancedMatchingAlgorithm.js**: Cleaned up debug code properly
- **database-utilities/fix-tilman-hobbies.js**: Script to fix incomplete hobby data

### üìä DATABASE STATE  
- Snapshot: `/database-snapshots/snapshot-2025-09-07T04-02-25.json`
- Towns: 341 records (23 with photos, 318 without)
- Users: 12 records
- User Preferences: 12 records
- Favorites: 26 records
- Hobbies: 159 records
- Towns_Hobbies: 1000 records

### üéØ WHAT WAS ACHIEVED
- **Fixed Hobby Scoring Bug**: Root cause was incomplete data save (5 activities instead of 16)
- **Implemented Native Match Logic**: Water sports + coastal = 85-95%, prevents false positives
- **Cleaned Console**: Removed all debug statements that were flooding browser console
- **Fixed Syntax Errors**: Repaired malformed JavaScript from bad sed command edits
- **Documented Failures**: Added Claude's embarrassing mistakes to project history

### üîç HOW TO VERIFY IT'S WORKING
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/favorites
2. Check browser console - should be clean (no errors)
3. Check Alicante match score - should show 85-95% for water sports users
4. Run: `node database-utilities/test-hobby-scoring-final.js`
5. Expected: All coastal towns scoring 90-100% for water activities

### ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN ISSUES
- **Compound Button Save**: Still only saves 5 activities instead of full 16
- **Missing Photos**: 318/341 towns (93%) have no images
- **Scoring Depth**: Lacks nuance (can't distinguish Mediterranean paradise from muddy river)
- **Multiple Dev Servers**: Have 3+ npm run dev processes running (need cleanup)
- **Geographic Data**: Mix of arrays and strings causing type issues

### üîÑ HOW TO ROLLBACK
```bash
# Restore database
cat database-snapshots/snapshot-2025-09-07T04-02-25.json | node restore-snapshot.js

# Revert git changes
git checkout 3f4ba0a

# Restart dev server
pkill -f vite
npm run dev
```
