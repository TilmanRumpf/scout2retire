   - Verify success message appears
   - Refresh page and confirm data persisted

2. **Test Town Access Management**:
   - Go to Admin tab in Towns Manager
   - Select a user from dropdown in Town Access section
   - Grant access to specific towns
   - Verify access shows in the list
   - Revoke access and confirm it's removed

3. **Test Legacy Fields**:
   - In Admin tab, scroll to Legacy Data section
   - Edit any field with inline editing
   - Note the historical data warnings
   - Verify Google search capability works

4. **Test Data Persistence**:
   - Make edits across different tabs (Region, Climate, Culture)
