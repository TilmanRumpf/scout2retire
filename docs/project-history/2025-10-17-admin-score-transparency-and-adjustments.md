  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  town_id UUID REFERENCES towns(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  category TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (...),
  subcategory TEXT,
  adjustment_value DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL CHECK (BETWEEN -5.0 AND 5.0),

---

## üéØ WHAT WAS ACHIEVED

### Problem Solved
**Before**: Exec admins had NO visibility into admin score calculations. They saw:
- Raw field values (healthcare_score: 7.5)
- No understanding of how these combine
- Hidden fields like crime_rate never shown
- No way to adjust for edge cases (island penalties, etc.)
- No way to fix incorrect algorithms

**After**: Complete transparency and control:
- **See**: Every raw field ‚Üí component ‚Üí subcategory ‚Üí final score
- **Adjust**: Add manual basis point adjustments with documented reasons
- **Edit**: Modify algorithm formulas and thresholds
- **Audit**: Full trail of who changed what and why

### Key Features
1. **Transparency**: Show calculation flow from raw data to final score
2. **Manual Overrides**: Basis point adjustments for edge cases
3. **Algorithm Editing**: Fix wrong formulas without code deployment
4. **Audit Trail**: Every adjustment tracked with reason, user, timestamp
5. **Scope Control**: Apply adjustments to single town, all islands, or custom filter

---

## üîç HOW TO VERIFY IT'S WORKING

### Manual Adjustment End-to-End Test

1. **Navigate** to http://localhost:5173/admin/towns (requires admin login)
2. **Select** any town (e.g., Bubaque)
3. **Click** "Admin" tab
4. **Expand** "Healthcare Quality" section
5. **See** calculated score (e.g., 3.0/10.0)
6. **Click** "Add Manual Adjustment" button
7. **Fill modal**:
   - Adjustment: `-0.5`
   - Reason: "Island accessibility penalty - ferry-dependent healthcare"
   - Apply to: "This town only (Bubaque)"
8. **Click** "Save Adjustment"
9. **Verify**:
   - Toast: "Manual adjustment saved successfully!"
   - Score shows: `3.0/10.0 ‚Üí 2.5/10.0 ‚úèÔ∏è`
   - Amber box appears: "Active Manual Adjustments: Island accessibility penalty -0.50"
10. **Reload page** and verify adjustment persists (loaded from database)

### Database Verification

```sql
-- Check adjustments were saved
SELECT * FROM admin_score_adjustments
WHERE town_id = 'bubaque-uuid'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Expected result:
-- id | town_id | category | adjustment_value | reason | created_by | created_at
-- uuid | bubaque-uuid | healthcare | -0.50 | Island accessibility penalty... | admin@example.com | 2025-10-17 ...
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN ISSUES

### None - All Core Features Working!

### Future Enhancements (Not Issues)
1. **Algorithm Editing Persistence**: Save formula changes to config file
2. **Custom Filter UI**: Build advanced filter builder for "custom_filter" scope
3. **Bulk Adjustments**: Apply same adjustment to multiple towns at once
4. **Adjustment History**: Show previous values and who changed them
5. **Recalculation Queue**: Background job to recalculate all towns when algorithm changes

## üîÑ HOW TO ROLLBACK

### Rollback Database Migration

```bash
# Connect to Supabase
supabase db reset

# Or manually drop the table
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS admin_score_adjustments CASCADE;"
```

### Rollback Code Changes

```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git log --oneline  # Find commit hash before this feature
git checkout <previous-commit-hash>

# Or remove specific files
rm src/components/ScoreBreakdownPanel.jsx
git checkout HEAD~1 src/pages/admin/TownsManager.jsx
```

### Clean Rollback Checkpoint

```bash
git checkout <commit-hash-before-transparency-feature>
supabase db reset
npm run dev
```

## üéì ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS

### Why Basis Points Instead of Percentages?
- More intuitive for admins: "-0.5 points" vs "-6.7%"
- Direct addition to score: 7.5 + (-0.5) = 7.0
- Easier to reason about cumulative adjustments

### Why Separate Adjustments Table?
- Audit trail preserved even if town data changes
- Can query "all adjustments by this admin"
- Can soft-delete without losing history
- Supports global adjustments (not tied to single town)

### Why Show Raw Fields + Formulas?
- Admins need to verify calculations are correct
- Debugging: "Why is this score low?" ‚Üí See exact field value
- Trust: No black box scoring
- Education: New admins learn how scoring works

### Why Allow Algorithm Editing?
- Algorithms may be wrong initially
- Business rules change (e.g., hospital threshold too strict)
- Faster iteration than code deployment
- Exec admins can experiment with formulas

## üìù EXAMPLE USE CASES

### Use Case 1: Island Accessibility Penalty

**Scenario**: Bubaque (island town) has hospital 60km away by ferry, but distance formula doesn't account for ferry time.

**Solution**:
1. Expand Healthcare Quality ‚Üí Accessibility
2. See: `Distance Score: 0.0 (nearest_major_hospital_km: 60)`
3. Add adjustment: `-0.5` with reason "Island ferry adds 2+ hours to emergency response"
4. Score adjusts: 3.0 ‚Üí 2.5

**Result**: More accurate healthcare accessibility score for island towns.

### Use Case 2: Europe Bonus Failed on Latvia

**Scenario**: Algorithm gives "Europe bonus" but Latvia has lower quality than expected.

**Solution**:
1. Expand Government Efficiency
2. Add adjustment: `-0.3` with reason "EU membership doesn't guarantee government efficiency in post-Soviet states"
3. Apply to: "Custom filter" ‚Üí `{"region": "Baltic States"}`
4. Score adjusts for Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia

**Result**: More nuanced regional scoring.

### Use Case 3: Wrong Hospital Threshold

**Scenario**: Algorithm gives 10+ hospitals = 1.0 bonus, but research shows 5+ is sufficient.

**Solution**:
1. Click "edit formula" on Hospital Count Bonus
2. Change thresholds:
   - 5-9 hospitals: 0.7 ‚Üí **1.0**
   - 10+ hospitals: 1.0 ‚Üí **1.2** (increase for major hubs)
3. Click "Save & Recalculate All Scores"
4. All 343 towns recalculate with new formula

**Result**: More accurate global scoring without code deployment.
