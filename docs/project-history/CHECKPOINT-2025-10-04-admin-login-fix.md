# üü¢ RECOVERY CHECKPOINT - October 4, 2025 22:01
## SYSTEM STATE: WORKING (Admin login restored)

### ‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING
- Admin users can now login without infinite recursion error
- RLS policies use SECURITY DEFINER function to bypass recursion
- Admin users can search/view all users in PaywallManager
- Admin users can update user tiers and roles
- Regular users can only view their own profile

### üîß RECENT CHANGES
**Files Modified:**
- `supabase/migrations/20251004143000_admin_can_search_users.sql` - Created (caused infinite recursion)
- `supabase/migrations/20251004200000_fix_users_rls_infinite_recursion.sql` - Created and applied (fixed recursion)

**Code Changes:**
1. Created `is_user_admin(user_id UUID)` function with SECURITY DEFINER
   - Location: Database function (not file-based)
   - Bypasses RLS when checking admin status
   - Returns boolean (true/false)

2. Updated RLS policies on `users` table:
   - `admins_can_select_all_users` - Uses is_user_admin() instead of subquery
   - `admins_can_update_user_tiers` - Uses is_user_admin() instead of subquery
   - `users_can_insert_own` - Users can create own profile
   - `admins_can_delete_users` - Only admins can delete users

**Why Changes Were Made:**
- Original migration queried `users` table within RLS policy to check `is_admin`
- This created infinite loop: SELECT users ‚Üí check is_admin ‚Üí SELECT users ‚Üí ‚àû
- SECURITY DEFINER function bypasses RLS for the admin check, breaking the loop

### üìä DATABASE STATE
- Snapshot attempted but service_role key appears expired
- Migration 20251004200000 successfully applied
- `is_user_admin()` function created and callable
- RLS policies updated with no infinite recursion

### üéØ WHAT WAS ACHIEVED
**Problem Solved:**
- Fixed infinite recursion error that prevented admin users from logging in
- Admin users were blocked by RLS policy that checked itself infinitely
- Login flow now works: auth ‚Üí is_user_admin() ‚Üí bypass RLS ‚Üí get admin status ‚Üí allow/deny

**Root Cause:**
- First migration (20251004143000) created policy with subquery on same table
- Policy checked `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE is_admin = true)`
- Every SELECT on users triggered policy, which did SELECT on users, which triggered policy...

**Solution:**
- Created SECURITY DEFINER function that runs with elevated privileges
- Function queries users table WITHOUT triggering RLS (definer's rights)
- Policy calls function instead of doing subquery
- No recursion: SELECT users ‚Üí call is_user_admin() ‚Üí function bypasses RLS ‚Üí return true/false

### üîç HOW TO VERIFY IT'S WORKING
**Test Admin Login:**
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/
2. Login with admin credentials
3. Should NOT see "infinite recursion detected in policy" error
4. Should successfully authenticate and load app

**Test Admin Permissions:**
1. Login as admin user
2. Navigate to PaywallManager
3. Should see "Users" tab with search functionality
4. Should be able to search and view all users
5. Should be able to update user tiers/roles

**Test Regular User:**
1. Login as non-admin user
2. Should only see own profile data
3. Should NOT see other users in any queries

### ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN ISSUES
- Service role key in .env may be expired (shows 1748706345 iat timestamp)
- Database snapshot feature unable to verify data due to key issue
- Need to test actual admin login to confirm 100% working

### üîÑ HOW TO ROLLBACK
**If admin login still fails:**
```bash
# Rollback migration
supabase migration repair 20251004200000 --status reverted

# Or drop the policies manually
supabase db push --include-all --dry-run  # Review changes
```

**Complete rollback:**
```bash
# Drop all new policies and function
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "admins_can_select_all_users" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "admins_can_update_user_tiers" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "users_can_insert_own" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "admins_can_delete_users" ON users;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS is_user_admin(UUID);
```
