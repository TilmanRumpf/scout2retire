# 🟢 RECOVERY CHECKPOINT - October 4, 2025 22:42
## SYSTEM STATE: WORKING (Before 52% dead code cleanup)

### ✅ WHAT'S WORKING
- Admin login fixed (infinite recursion resolved)
- 351 towns in database, 193 with photos (55%)
- All core features functional
- Matching algorithms operational
- User authentication working

### 🔧 RECENT CHANGES
**Just completed:**
- Fixed admin login RLS infinite recursion (migration 20251004200000)
- Created is_user_admin() SECURITY DEFINER function
- Updated CLAUDE.md with file freshness protocol

**About to do:**
- Remove 52% dead code (171 test files + 3 unused utils)
- Archive test/debug files to archive/debug-oct-2025/
- Delete completely unused utilities

### 📊 DATABASE STATE
- Snapshot: database-snapshots/2025-10-05T03-42-36
- Towns: 351
- Users: Active (service key issue prevents count)
- No data changes in this cleanup (code only)

### 🎯 WHAT WAS ACHIEVED
- Deep analysis revealed 52% dead code (not 30% from CLAUDE.md)
- Identified 171 test/debug files for archival
- Found 3 completely unused utility files
- Updated CLAUDE.md with real-time verification protocol

### 🔍 CURRENT CODE INVENTORY
**Production files:** 160
- 130 in src/
- 30 clean files in root

**Dead code:** 174 files (52%)
- 171 test/debug files (check-*, test-*, debug-*, analyze-*)
- 3 unused utils (dataTransformations.js, hobbiesUtils.js, simpleRetirementIcons.js)

### ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES
- Service role key appears expired (can't verify data counts)
- 23 utils in flat src/utils/ (should be in subdirectories)
- Root directory still has 34 debug files

### 🔄 HOW TO ROLLBACK
**If cleanup breaks something:**
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD
# Or restore from this checkpoint
git checkout 8137858  # Current commit before cleanup
```

**Files being removed are 120% safe:**
- All test-*.js, debug-*.js, check-*.js files
- Unused utils verified by grep analysis
- Nothing imported in production code

### 🔎 SEARCH KEYWORDS
- dead code cleanup October 2025
- 52 percent dead code
- test debug files archive
- unused utils removal
- pre-cleanup checkpoint
- code inventory analysis
- 171 test files
- dataTransformations unused
