# üü¢ RECOVERY CHECKPOINT - August 26, 2025 21:54
## SYSTEM STATE: WORKING

### ‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING
- **Full application functional** - All core features operational
- **Database integrity maintained** - 341 towns, 12 users, 27 favorites
- **Geographic features data** - All 341 towns have geographic_features_actual populated
- **Vegetation data** - All towns have vegetation_type_actual populated  
- **Case sensitivity bug identified** - Found mixed case data (lowercase vs Proper Case) in geographic_features_actual
- **Documentation reorganized** - Algorithm docs moved from docs/database/ to docs/algorithms/ (15 files)
- **Project structure clean** - All files in proper directories per CLAUDE.md rules

### üîß RECENT CHANGES
- **docs/database/** - Moved algorithm-related files OUT (only 2 database docs remain)
- **docs/algorithms/** - Moved 15 algorithm/matching files IN (proper organization)
- **No code changes** - Only documentation reorganization
- **Database analysis completed** - Identified case pollution sources:
  - June 23, 2025: Early data entry used lowercase
  - July 12, 2025: Bulk import used Proper Case
  - July 23, 2025: Recent entry reverted to lowercase

### üìä DATABASE STATE  
- Snapshot: database-snapshots/2025-08-26T21-53-34
- **users**: 12 records
- **towns**: 341 records (all with geographic/vegetation data)
- **user_preferences**: 12 records
- **favorites**: 27 records
- **notifications**: 5 records
- **shared_towns**: 0 records (table doesn't exist yet)
- **invitations**: 0 records (table doesn't exist yet)
- **reviews**: 0 records (table doesn't exist yet)

### üéØ WHAT WAS ACHIEVED
- **Documentation properly organized** - All algorithm docs in correct folder
- **Case sensitivity root cause identified** - Multiple data import sources with different formatting
- **Industry standards researched** - ISO 3166 for countries, BCP 47 for languages
- **Decision made** - Keep simple approach with full names, just use .toLowerCase() everywhere
- **Clean file structure** - No test files or debug scripts in root

### üîç HOW TO VERIFY IT'S WORKING
1. Check docs organization: `ls docs/algorithms/` should show 15 matching/algorithm files
2. Check docs/database/ should only have 2 data normalization files
3. Run app: `npm run dev` and navigate to http://localhost:5173
4. Test town search and filtering
5. Verify favorites still work for logged-in users

### ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN ISSUES
- **Case inconsistency in geographic_features_actual** - Mix of lowercase and Proper Case
- **Missing display columns** - No geographic_features_display column
- **Country/Language format** - Using full names instead of ISO codes (decision: keep as-is)
- **3 tables don't exist yet** - shared_towns, invitations, reviews (expected)

### üîÑ HOW TO ROLLBACK
```bash
# Restore database
node restore-database-snapshot.js 2025-08-26T21-53-34

# Revert git changes
git checkout 957c155

# Move docs back if needed (unlikely)
mv docs/algorithms/MATCHING_*.md docs/database/
```
