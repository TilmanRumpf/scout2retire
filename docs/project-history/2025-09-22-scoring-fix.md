# üü¢ RECOVERY CHECKPOINT - 2025-09-22 22:16
## SYSTEM STATE: WORKING

### ‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING
- Homepage displays favorites with personalized match scores
- TownDiscovery shows towns with consistent scores
- DailyTownCard displays scored town of the day
- All towns show personalized scores based on user preferences
- No more 0% vs 90% discrepancies between views

### üîß RECENT CHANGES
- **src/pages/Home.jsx (lines 34-67)**: Added scoring logic after fetching favorites
  - Imports scoreTown and getOnboardingProgress
  - Scores each favorite town with user preferences
  - Falls back gracefully if scoring fails
- **src/utils/townUtils.jsx**: Kept fetchFavorites simple (no changes)

### üìä DATABASE STATE
- Snapshot: database-snapshots/2025-09-22T22-16-02
- Users: 13 records
- Towns: 341 records
- User preferences: 12 records
- Favorites: 26 records
- No score columns added (reverted universal scoring approach)

### üéØ WHAT WAS ACHIEVED
- Fixed scoring inconsistency where same town showed different scores on different pages
- Identified root cause: favorites weren't being scored with user preferences
- Applied proper fix: score favorites in the component that displays them
- Avoided wrong approach of universal scoring (each user needs personalized scores)
- Maintained performance by only scoring when displaying

### üîç HOW TO VERIFY IT'S WORKING
1. Log in as any user with favorites
2. Go to homepage - favorites should show match percentages
3. Click on a favorite to go to TownDiscovery
4. Same town should show same match percentage
5. Check console for any "Failed to score favorite" warnings

### ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN ISSUES
- None identified after fix

### üîÑ HOW TO ROLLBACK
```bash
git reset --hard 01c46c4  # Before any scoring changes
node restore-database-snapshot.js 2025-09-22T22-16-02
```
