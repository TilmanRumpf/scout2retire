# üü¢ RECOVERY CHECKPOINT - October 19, 2025 22:30
## SYSTEM STATE: WORKING

### ‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING
- **Daily Page Mobile UX**: Top Matches section is now collapsible on mobile/tablet screens (< 1024px)
  - Starts collapsed by default with "Show/Hide" toggle button
  - Limits to 5 towns on mobile/tablet instead of 10
  - Featured Town and Today's Inspiration appear immediately without scrolling
  - Desktop (1024px+) shows full 2 rows of 5 towns (10 total), always expanded
  - Clean, compact layout with town name and percentage on same line

- **Chat Lobby Like Buttons**: Popular Country Lounges now have heart buttons
  - 8 popular countries (USA, Canada, Mexico, Portugal, Spain, Costa Rica, Italy, France)
  - Heart icons show like/unlike status (filled red ‚ù§Ô∏è = liked, outline gray ü§ç = not liked)
  - Click to toggle like/unlike instantly
  - Liked countries appear in "My Countries" in Lounges tab
  - Consistent UX with town favorites and other lounge features

- **Header Improvements**:
  - "Scout2Retire" text now completely hidden at all resolutions (not just 820x1180)
  - Only logo icon shows on all screen sizes
  - Favorites page header no longer shows "(X of Y)" count
  - Cleaner, more professional header appearance

### üéØ WHAT WAS ACHIEVED

**Mobile-First Daily Page UX Optimization**:
- Eliminated scroll fatigue on mobile - users now see Featured Town and Today's Inspiration immediately
- Improved daily engagement - the most visually appealing content (images) appears first
- Optional Top Matches - users can expand if they want to browse, but not forced to scroll through text list
- Maintains full functionality on desktop - no features removed, just better mobile organization
- Compact town cards - name and percentage on same line saves vertical space

**Complete Chat Like System**:
- Closed UX gap where Popular Country Lounges couldn't be favorited from Lobby tab
- Consistent heart button pattern across all chat features (friends, groups, towns, countries)
- Users can now favorite countries directly from the main Lobby view
- Immediate visual feedback with filled/outline heart states

**Header Polish**:
- Cleaner branding - logo only, no text clutter at any resolution
- Favorites page focused on content, not counts
- Professional appearance across all viewport sizes

### üîç HOW TO VERIFY IT'S WORKING

**Daily Page Collapsible Top Matches**:
1. Open http://localhost:5173/daily on mobile viewport (< 1024px width)
2. Verify "Your Top Matches" section shows collapsed with "Show >" button
3. Verify Featured Town is immediately visible without scrolling
4. Click "Show >" button - should expand to show 5 town cards
5. Each card should show: Town name, Country on left | 88% badge on right (single line)
6. Desktop (> 1024px): Should show 2 rows of 5 towns, always expanded, no toggle button

**Chat Lobby Like Buttons**:
1. Navigate to Chat page, Lobby tab
2. Scroll to "Popular Country Lounges" section
3. Each of 8 countries should have a heart icon on the right
4. Click a gray outline heart - should turn red filled and country added to "My Countries"
5. Go to Lounges tab ‚Üí Country Lounge ‚Üí verify country appears in "My Countries"
6. Click filled red heart - should turn gray outline and remove from "My Countries"

**Header Changes**:
1. Check header at any resolution - should show only logo icon, no "Scout2Retire" text
2. Navigate to Favorites page - title should show "Favorites" with no "(X of Y)" count

### ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN ISSUES
