## Overview
Scotty can help users plan multi-day exploration trips to discover potential retirement destinations. This guide explains Scotty's travel planning capabilities.

## ‚úÖ What Scotty CAN Do

### 1. **Multi-Day Itinerary Planning**
Scotty can create detailed travel itineraries based on:
- Starting airport (e.g., "Vancouver International", "Toronto Pearson", "Montreal")
- Number of days available (e.g., "7 days", "2 weeks")
- Travel radius from starting point
- User's retirement preferences (climate, budget, lifestyle)

### 2. **Airport-Based Route Planning**
- Identifies towns within practical driving distance from major airports
- Suggests optimal routes considering geography and travel time
- Balances diversity of experiences (coastal vs. inland, urban vs. small town)

### 3. **Personalized Recommendations**
Scotty considers:
- **User's favorited towns** - Prioritizes places they've already shown interest in
- **Budget preferences** - Suggests towns matching their cost-of-living requirements
- **Climate preferences** - Recommends suitable weather conditions
- **Lifestyle needs** - Matches pace of life, cultural events, healthcare access

### 4. **Practical Travel Advice**

## üéØ How Scotty Builds Itineraries

### Step 1: Understand Context
- Checks user's favorited towns
- Reviews user's climate/budget/lifestyle preferences
- Identifies starting airport location

### Step 2: Geographic Filtering
- Calculates practical travel radius (typically 3-5 hours drive max)
- Identifies towns in Scout2Retire database within that area
- Ensures geographic diversity in selections

### Step 3: Itinerary Optimization
- Creates logical driving routes (minimize backtracking)
- Suggests 1-2 nights per town for proper evaluation
- Balances different town types (coastal, mountain, urban, rural)

### Step 4: Enrichment
- Adds specific things to evaluate in each town
- Suggests best neighborhoods to explore
- Recommends local resources (expat groups, healthcare facilities)

## üí° Tips for Best Results

### Be Specific About:
1. **Starting point** - "Vancouver airport" vs. just "Vancouver"
2. **Time available** - "7 days" vs. "a week or so"
3. **Transportation** - Scotty assumes car rental unless told otherwise
4. **Priorities** - "Focus on coastal towns" or "I want to see mountain communities"

### Sample Perfect Query:
```
"I'm flying into Montreal and renting a car. I have 8 days to explore
Quebec and maritime provinces. I love coastal towns with good healthcare
and moderate cost of living. What route should I take?"
```

explore some wonderful BC retirement towns. Here's a route that
balances coastal charm, mountain beauty, and practical amenities:

Day 1-2: Victoria (90-min ferry from Vancouver)
