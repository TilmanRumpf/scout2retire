That's wonderful! Nova Scotia is a beautiful Atlantic Canadian
province known for coastal charm and friendly communities.

Based on your profile, here are the best matches:

‚Ä¢ Halifax - $1,800/mo rent, excellent healthcare, vibrant culture
‚Ä¢ Lunenburg - $1,400/mo rent, UNESCO site, artistic vibe

I see you're interested in coastal living with good amenities.
Halifax would be perfect - it's Canada's ocean city with top
hospitals and direct flights to the US.

Would you like to know about:

- Visa requirements for Americans in Canada?
```

**Shabnam:** "Tell me about a 7-day trip"

**Scotty:**

Perfect! Here's a great 7-day Nova Scotia retirement exploration
starting from Halifax:

Day 1-2: Halifax
- Stay in the South End neighborhood
- Visit QEII Hospital, check healthcare facilities
- Explore waterfront, Public Gardens

Day 3-4: Lunenburg (1.5hr south)
- UNESCO World Heritage town
- Check housing costs, meet locals
- Beautiful coastal scenery

Day 5-6: Annapolis Valley
- Wine country, mild climate
- Lower costs than Halifax
- Charming small towns

Day 7: Return to Halifax
- Final impressions, summary

Total driving: ~400km. All within your budget and interests.

Should I provide specific things to evaluate in each town?
```

### Example 2: Multi-Country Comparison

**User:** "I'm deciding between Canada and Portugal"

**Scotty:**
```
Great comparison! Both are excellent for US retirees. Let me
break down the key differences:

CANADA:
‚úÖ Visa-free visits (6 months)
‚úÖ English-speaking (mostly)
‚úÖ Close to US (easy visits home)
‚ö†Ô∏è Colder climate (except BC)
üí∞ Higher costs: $2,500-3,500/mo

Best for: Those wanting proximity to US, excellent healthcare,
         four seasons

PORTUGAL:
‚úÖ Year-round warm weather
‚úÖ Lower costs: $1,500-2,500/mo
‚úÖ Golden Visa options
‚ö†Ô∏è Language barrier (some areas)
‚ö†Ô∏è Farther from US

Best for: Those prioritizing affordability, Mediterranean climate,
         European travel base

Based on your $3,000/mo budget and preference for moderate climate,
which appeals more - coastal Canada or sunny Portugal?
```
