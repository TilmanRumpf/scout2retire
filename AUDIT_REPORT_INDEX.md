## The Main Problem

Admins can edit only **37 out of 170+ fields** in the towns database.

This means:
- Users see 100+ fields of data on the town discovery page
- But admins can ONLY edit 37 of them directly
- 60 fields are displayed but locked
- 70+ fields are completely hidden from admins

**Result:** Data quality suffers because admins can't fix visible errors.

## The 4 CRITICAL Gaps (Fix This Week)

### 1. Hobbies & Activities (0 editable)
**8 missing fields:** golf_courses_count, hiking_trails_km, tennis_courts_count, marinas_count, ski_resorts_within_100km, dog_parks_count, farmers_markets, outdoor_rating

**Impact:** ðŸ”´ Users see this data on the page. Admins can't fix it.

---

### 2. Culture Ratings (0 editable)
**6 missing fields:** cultural_events_rating, nightlife_rating, restaurants_rating, museums_rating, shopping_rating, cultural_landmark_1

**Impact:** ðŸ”´ Users see ratings. Admins can't update them.

---

### 3. Internet Speed (Partially editable)
**Problem:** Field exists in Admin Panel but ISN'T ACTUALLY EDITABLE. It's just displayed!

**Impact:** ðŸ”´ Major UX confusion - looks editable but isn't.

---

### 4. Cost Details (0 editable)
**2 missing fields:** groceries_cost, meal_cost

**Impact:** ðŸ”´ Displayed on page, admins can't fix it.

## Implementation Quick Start

### To add a single editable field (5 minutes):

1. **Add metadata** in `/src/utils/admin/adminFieldMetadata.js`:
```javascript
my_field_name: {
  label: 'Display Name',
  type: 'number', // or 'string', 'boolean', 'select'
  range: '0-100', // or ['option1', 'option2']
  description: 'Help text for admins',
  editable: true,
  unit: 'unit',
  category: 'section',
  validator: (val) => val >= 0 && val <= 100
}
```

2. **Add UI** in appropriate panel (`RegionPanel.jsx`, etc.):
```javascript
<EditableField
  field="my_field_name"
  value={town.my_field_name}
  label="Display Name"
  type="number"
  range="0-100"
  description="Help text"
/>
```

3. **Done!** EditableDataField handles database sync automatically.
