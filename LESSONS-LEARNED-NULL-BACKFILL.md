# LESSONS LEARNED: Canadian Towns NULL Backfill Session

**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Duration:** ~3 hours
**Objective:** Backfill ALL NULL columns in 20 Canadian towns

---

## ❌ WHAT I DID WRONG (AGAIN)

### 1. **NEVER QUERIED THE SCHEMA FIRST**
- Generated SQL for hours without knowing actual column types
- Guessed that arrays were JSONB when some were text[]
- Guessed that numbers were integers when some were JSONB
- **Wasted 2+ hours on syntax errors that could have been avoided**

### 2. **DIDN'T TEST ONE COMPLETE TOWN BEFORE SCALING**
- Created "comprehensive" SQL files without verifying they worked
- When I finally tested one town (Annapolis Royal), it took 20+ iterations to get syntax right
- Only AFTER getting one town working did I scale to 20 towns
- But the scaled version was INCOMPLETE - only had 10 fields instead of 92

### 3. **GENERATED INCOMPLETE BACKFILL SQL**
- The `generate-all-20-sql.js` script only had ~10 fields
- Should have had ALL 92 fields that were NULL
- User ran it thinking it was complete
- Result: Only 1/20 towns fully backfilled

### 4. **DIDN'T USE THE WORKING TEMPLATE**
- Had `FINAL-ONE-TOWN-CORRECT.sql` with ~100 fields that WORKED
- Instead of using that as a template for all 20 towns, I created a new incomplete script
- **Professional approach:** Copy the working SQL, parameterize it, scale it

### 5. **KEPT TRYING TO USE SDK INSTEAD OF SQL EDITOR**
- Spent 1+ hour trying to make JavaScript SDK work
- RLS was blocking it the whole time
- Should have moved to SQL Editor approach immediately after first RLS error

## ✅ WHAT WORKED

### 1. **Getting the Complete Schema**
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, udt_name
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'towns'
ORDER BY column_name;
```
This was the FIRST thing I should have done. It told me:
- `activity_infrastructure` = JSONB
- `environmental_factors` = JSONB
- `pet_friendliness` = JSONB
- `residency_path_info` = JSONB
- Most arrays = text[]
- Most ratings = integer

### 2. **Testing One Complete Town First**
`FINAL-ONE-TOWN-CORRECT.sql` - 100+ fields, all correct syntax, tested and working

### 3. **Using Supabase SQL Editor with Admin Access**
- Bypasses RLS completely
- Can see actual errors immediately
- Fast iteration on syntax

### 4. **Correct Syntax Patterns Discovered:**
```sql
-- JSONB arrays
activity_infrastructure = jsonb_build_array('a','b','c')

-- JSONB single values
pet_friendliness = to_jsonb(8)

-- JSONB text
residency_path_info = '"text here"'::jsonb

-- JSONB objects
audit_data = '{"key":"value"}'::jsonb

-- text[] arrays
local_mobility_options = ARRAY['a','b','c']::text[]

-- Integers
travel_connectivity_rating = 6

-- Text with apostrophes
description = 'Canada''s oldest...'  -- Double the apostrophe
```

## 📋 THE PROFESSIONAL APPROACH (WHAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE)

### Step 1: Get Schema (5 min)
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'towns' ORDER BY column_name;
```

### Step 2: Test ONE field, ONE town (2 min)
```sql
UPDATE towns SET cost_index = 80 WHERE name = 'Annapolis Royal';
SELECT cost_index FROM towns WHERE name = 'Annapolis Royal';
```

### Step 3: Test ONE complete town (30 min)
Build complete UPDATE with ALL fields, test it, verify it works

### Step 4: Use working SQL as template (10 min)
Copy the working SQL, create a script that replaces town-specific values

### Step 5: Generate SQL for all 20 towns (5 min)
Use the template to generate 20 UPDATE statements

### Step 6: Execute and verify (5 min)
Run SQL, audit for NULLs

**Total time if done right: ~1 hour**
**Actual time with my approach: 3+ hours and still not done**

## 🔧 CORRECT APPROACH GOING FORWARD

1. **ALWAYS query schema FIRST before writing any SQL**
2. **ALWAYS test one complete case before scaling**
3. **ALWAYS use the working template, don't recreate from scratch**
4. **ALWAYS verify completeness before asking user to run**
5. **STOP trying to be clever with SDK when SQL Editor works**

---

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

- Use `FINAL-ONE-TOWN-CORRECT.sql` as template
- Generate complete SQL for remaining 19 towns
- Include ALL 92 fields that were NULL
- Execute and verify ZERO NULLs remain

**USER'S FEEDBACK:**
> "please note, that i can easily forecast that this will not be professionally executed by you, we will keep on doing this over, and over..."

**He was 100% right. This is exactly what happened.**

**I must stop guessing and start verifying. Every. Single. Time.**
