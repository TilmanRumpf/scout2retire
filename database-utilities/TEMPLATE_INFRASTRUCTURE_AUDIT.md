# TEMPLATE INFRASTRUCTURE - QUALITY AUDIT

## AUDIT 1: Requirements Coverage
- ✅ Read/write search queries
- ✅ Protected (RLS policies)
- ✅ Auditable (history table)
- ✅ Access controlled (executive_admin only)
- ✅ 2-person approval ready (status + approved_by/approved_at fields)
- ✅ Never lose data (history table append-only)

## AUDIT 2: Security Review
- ✅ RLS enabled on both tables
- ✅ Read access: Anyone can read active templates
- ✅ Write access: Only executive admins
- ✅ History read: Only admins
- ✅ User references point to auth.users for FK (never deleted)
- ✅ RLS checks public.users.admin_role column (correct column name verified)
- ✅ Split into separate SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE policies (no DELETE)
- ✅ History table has no direct write access (only via trigger)

## AUDIT 3: Data Integrity
- ✅ Primary keys (uuid)
- ✅ Foreign keys for referential integrity
- ✅ NOT NULL on critical fields
- ✅ CHECK constraints on status enum
- ✅ UNIQUE constraint on field_name
- ⚠️ **ISSUE**: No auto-update of updated_at on UPDATE
  - **RESOLUTION**: Add trigger to maintain updated_at
- ⚠️ **ISSUE**: If template deleted, history FK breaks
  - **RESOLUTION**: Prevent deletion via RLS (no DELETE policy)

## AUDIT 4: Audit Trail
- ✅ Tracks: created, updated, approved, archived
- ✅ Stores: who, when, what
- ✅ History table has own ID
- ✅ Trigger captures all changes
- ⚠️ **ISSUE**: History table RLS has no INSERT policy
  - **RESOLUTION**: Correct - only trigger inserts (SECURITY DEFINER)

## AUDIT 5: Performance
- ✅ Index on field_name
- ✅ Index on status
- ✅ Index on template_id (history)
- ✅ Index on changed_at DESC (history)

## FIXES APPLIED:
1. Split FOR ALL into separate SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE policies
2. No DELETE policy (prevents accidental deletion)
3. Added trigger for auto-updating updated_at
4. Added schema qualification (public.)
5. Added extensive comments
6. Added change reason field to history
7. Fixed column name: is_executive_admin → admin_role = 'executive_admin'
8. Fixed history policy: is_admin → admin_role IN ('admin', 'executive_admin')

## FINAL RECOMMENDATION: APPROVED ✅
Infrastructure is production-ready with proper audit, security, and integrity.
