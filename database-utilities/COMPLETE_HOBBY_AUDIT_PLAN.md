# ðŸŽ¯ COMPLETE HOBBY VERIFICATION AUDIT - ALL 173 HOBBIES

## THE MISSION
Verify EVERY field for ALL 173 hobbies in batches of 10
Ensure each hobby has correct:
- category (activity vs interest)
- is_universal (true/false)
- verification_method (universal/ai_community/ai_facilities/database_geographic/database_infrastructure)
- verification_query (NULL for universal, specific query for others)
- verification_notes (clear explanation)
- required_conditions (NULL or valid needs array)

## BATCH PROCESSING PROTOCOL

### For Each Batch of 10:
1. **GET** the next 10 hobbies with ALL fields
2. **SHOW** current values and proposed fixes
3. **WAIT** for user approval/modifications
4. **UPDATE** the batch
5. **CONFIRM** success
6. **MOVE** to next batch

### SQL TO GET EACH BATCH
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  name,
  category,
  group_name,
  is_universal,
  verification_method,
  verification_query,
  verification_notes,
  required_conditions
FROM hobbies
ORDER BY name
LIMIT 10 OFFSET {batch_number * 10};
```

## VERIFICATION RULES

### Category Assignment:
- **activity** = Physical doing (sports, dancing, cooking)
- **interest** = Mental/passive (reading, collecting, watching)

### Universal vs Location-Dependent:
- **Universal** = Can be done anywhere with basic equipment/internet
- **Not Universal** = Needs specific geography/facilities/community

### Verification Methods:
- **universal** â†’ query = NULL, notes explain why universal
- **ai_community** â†’ query = "Are there {hobby} groups in {town}?"
- **ai_facilities** â†’ query = "Find {facility} in {town}"
- **database_geographic** â†’ query = SQL conditions
- **database_infrastructure** â†’ query = SQL column checks

## RECOVERY INSTRUCTIONS
If Claude crashes:
1. Check this file for last completed batch
2. Run: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM hobbies WHERE verification_query IS NOT NULL;`
3. Continue from next uncompleted batch
4. Each batch is independent - can restart anytime

## START COMMAND
