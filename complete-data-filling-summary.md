2. Create data quality dashboards
3. Consider automated data updates
4. Focus on photo acquisition (biggest UX gap)

## 💡 Technical Approach

### Smart Estimation Methods:
- **Population-based scaling** (larger cities → more amenities)
- **Geographic modifiers** (coastal → better air quality)
- **Country baselines** with regional adjustments
- **Known hub recognition** (medical tourism, expat centers)
- **Relationship modeling** (rent → total costs)

### Data Quality Principles:
- Conservative estimates when uncertain
- Logical consistency across related fields
- Regional patterns over arbitrary defaults
- Real-world knowledge integration
