# üü¢ RECOVERY CHECKPOINT - 2025-09-04-1047
## SYSTEM STATE: WORKING - Compound Buttons Persistence Fixed

### ‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING
- **Compound Button Persistence**: All 10 compound buttons (Walking & Cycling, Museums & History, etc.) now persist correctly after browser refresh
- **Auto-Save Functionality**: Buttons auto-save within 1.5 seconds without requiring Next button click
- **Hobby Selection System**: Users can select activities and interests that persist across sessions
- **Database Integration**: Proper save/load cycle with Supabase storing compound IDs correctly
- **User Authentication**: Login system working with test user tobiasrumpf@gmx.de
- **Onboarding Flow**: Multi-step onboarding process functional with progress tracking
- **Town Matching**: 343 towns in database ready for hobby-based matching
- **Development Environment**: Vite dev server running smoothly with HMR

### üîß RECENT CHANGES
**File: /src/pages/onboarding/OnboardingHobbies.jsx**
- Line 382-417: Modified `autoSave` function to accept `dataOverride` parameter to fix closure issue
- Line 724-774: Updated `handleActivityToggle` to pass updated form data to auto-save
- Line 777-810: Updated `handleInterestToggle` to pass updated form data to auto-save
- Line 628-638: Added comprehensive debug logging for tracking Museums & History persistence
- Line 688-691: Added final state verification logging before setting formData

**Key Code Changes:**
```javascript
// BEFORE: State closure issue
const autoSave = async () => {
  // Used potentially stale formData from closure
}

// AFTER: Accepts updated data
const autoSave = async (dataOverride = null) => {
  const dataToUse = dataOverride || formData;
  // Uses fresh data passed from setState
}
```

### üìä DATABASE STATE
- **Snapshot Path**: Will be created at db-backups/s2r-backup-2025-09-04-1047.sql
- **Tables Status**:
  - `towns`: 343 records with hobbies populated
  - `hobbies`: 185 hobby records with categories
  - `towns_hobbies`: Fully populated junction table
  - `user_preferences`: Stores compound button selections
  - `onboarding_responses`: Tracks user progress
- **Key User Data**: 
  - User ID: d1039857-71e2-4562-86aa-1f0b4a0c17c8
  - Email: tobiasrumpf@gmx.de
  - Has 14 expanded hobbies from compound selections

### üéØ WHAT WAS ACHIEVED
- **Fixed Critical Bug**: Museums & History button (and all compound buttons) not persisting after refresh
- **Identified Root Cause**: React state closure issue in auto-save timeout callback
- **Implemented Two-Layer Fix**:
  1. Kept compound IDs intact in UI state (no splitting)
  2. Passed updated data directly to auto-save to avoid closure staleness
- **Added Comprehensive Logging**: Debug messages track entire save/load cycle
- **Created Test Scripts**: Automated and manual test procedures documented
- **User Confirmation**: User verified "now it works" - complete success

### üîç HOW TO VERIFY IT'S WORKING
1. **Test Compound Button Persistence**:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to http://localhost:5173/
   # Login with tobiasrumpf@gmx.de / password123
   # Go to /onboarding/hobbies
   # Click any compound button (e.g., Museums & History)
   # Wait 1.5 seconds for auto-save
   # Refresh browser
   # Button should remain selected
   ```

2. **Check Console Logs**:
   - Should see: `Interest toggle clicked: history`
   - Should see: `‚è∞ Auto-save triggered for interests with updated data`
   - Should see: `Has history?: true`
   - After refresh: `Has interest_history?: true`

3. **Verify Database**:
   ```sql
   SELECT custom_activities 
   FROM user_preferences 
   WHERE user_id = 'd1039857-71e2-4562-86aa-1f0b4a0c17c8';
   -- Should contain 'interest_history' for Museums & History
   ```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN ISSUES
- **Photo Coverage**: Only 23 of 343 towns have photos (93% missing)
- **Multiple Dev Servers**: 3 npm dev instances running (cleanup needed)
- **Test Files in Root**: Several test-*.js files should be archived
- **Scoring Algorithm**: Needs verification for Alicante water sports matching

### üîÑ HOW TO ROLLBACK
```bash
# Restore database
supabase db restore db-backups/s2r-backup-2025-09-04-1047.sql

# Revert git changes
git checkout 2025-09-04-1047

# Restart dev server
pkill -f "npm run dev"
npm run dev
```
