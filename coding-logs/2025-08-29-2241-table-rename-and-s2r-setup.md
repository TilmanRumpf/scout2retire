# S2R Progress Report: 2025-08-29-2241

## Session Overview
**Start Time:** August 29, 2025 ~21:00 EST  
**End Time:** August 29, 2025 22:41 EST  
**Duration:** ~1.5 hours  
**Checkpoint ID:** 2025-08-29-2241

## Objectives Accomplished
1. ✅ Fixed critical table naming issue (town_hobbies → towns_hobbies)
2. ✅ Established source of truth (cloud database is authoritative)
3. ✅ Set up complete S2R checkpoint system with 7 commands
4. ✅ Created command reference manual

## Key Code Changes

### 1. Table Renaming Migration
- **Cloud Database:** Renamed `town_hobbies` to `towns_hobbies` for consistency
- **Files Updated:**
  - `src/utils/scoring/helpers/hobbiesMatching.js` - Lines 50, 58
  - `src/components/admin/HobbiesDisplay.jsx` - Line 30
- **Impact:** Hobby matching algorithm now works correctly with 20,478 town-hobby relationships

### 2. S2R System Implementation
- **Created Directories:**
  - `coding-logs/` - For session progress reports
  - `db-backups/` - For database snapshots
  - `.claude/commands/` - For command definitions
  - `~/.claude/commands/` - For global S2R commands

- **Installed Commands:**
  - `/s2r-1` through `/s2r-7` - Complete project management suite
  - Includes checkpoint creation, restoration, and memory refresh capabilities

## Problems Solved
1. **Table Naming Confusion:** Resolved 6-8 hours of work where table names were inconsistent
2. **Source of Truth:** Clarified that cloud database (not local Docker) is authoritative
3. **Project Management:** Implemented structured checkpoint system for safe return points

## Critical Decisions Made
1. **Naming Convention:** All tables use plural form (users, towns, hobbies, towns_hobbies)
2. **Database Authority:** Cloud database at axlruvvsjepsulcbqlho.supabase.co is the gold standard
3. **Memory Management:** Three-tier memory refresh system (short/long/strategic)

## Discoveries
- Local Docker database hasn't been used in a month
- App connects directly to cloud Supabase (not local)
- 173 hobbies all properly Title Cased after previous fixes
- Only 17/341 towns have hobbies linked (5% coverage - needs attention)

## Current Project State
- **Frontend:** ✅ Working - hobby matching integrated
- **Backend:** ✅ Working - correct table references
- **Database:** ✅ Working - towns_hobbies table accessible
- **Git:** ✅ Clean - all changes committed and pushed

## Next Steps
1. Populate hobbies for remaining 324 towns (currently only 17 have data)
2. Implement data management system from HOLISTIC_DATA_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM.md
3. Address 227 water towns with 0 marinas data issue
4. Continue with column-wise data updates for infrastructure

## Files Modified
- `/src/utils/scoring/helpers/hobbiesMatching.js`
- `/src/components/admin/HobbiesDisplay.jsx`
- `/supabase/migrations/20250830_rename_town_hobbies_to_towns_hobbies.sql` (created)
- `/.claude/commands/` (multiple command files)
- `/coding-logs/instructions.md`
- `/coding-logs/S2R-MANUAL.md`

## Database State
- **Table:** towns_hobbies (renamed from town_hobbies)
- **Records:** 20,478 town-hobby relationships
- **Hobbies:** 173 total, all Title Case
- **Coverage:** 17/341 towns have hobbies assigned

## Lessons Learned
1. Always verify which database is being used (cloud vs local)
2. Maintain consistent naming conventions across all tables
3. Document checkpoint system for easy project recovery
4. Local database is gold standard means the one you're actively developing against
