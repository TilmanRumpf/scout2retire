# üîç PROGRESS REPORT: Cost Data Discovery & Strategy Planning
**Checkpoint ID:** 2025-09-21-2025  
**Session Date:** September 21, 2025  
**Start Time:** ~19:25  
**End Time:** 20:25  
**Duration:** ~1 hour  

## üìã SESSION OBJECTIVES
- Investigate cost data infrastructure and algorithms
- Understand existing cost calculation methodologies  
- Identify gaps in town cost data coverage
- Plan strategy for data normalization and backfill

## ‚úÖ ACCOMPLISHMENTS

### 1. **Discovered Comprehensive Cost Infrastructure**
   - Located 5+ existing cost calculation scripts in `database-utilities/`
   - Identified multiplier-based cost algorithm (Rent √ó Country Multiplier)
   - Found detailed component breakdown system (transport, groceries, healthcare, etc.)
   - Mapped all cost-related database fields

### 2. **Documented Cost Algorithm Components**
   - Base: Rent (1-bedroom) as foundation
   - Transport: $50-400/month (country/city specific)
   - Groceries/Utilities: Country-specific rates
   - Healthcare: Monthly healthcare costs
   - Entertainment: Based on lifestyle ratings
   - Personal/Household: $100-250 by country
   - Insurance: Additional coverage beyond health
   - Conservative rounding: UP to nearest $50

### 3. **Identified Country Multiplier System**
   - High-cost (USA, Canada): 2.6-2.8x rent
   - Medium-cost (France, Germany): 2.2-2.3x rent  
   - Low-cost (Thailand, Vietnam): 1.7-1.8x rent
   - Island premium: +0.2-0.3x for import costs

### 4. **Created Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Detailed session report in `docs/project-history/`
   - Mapped all existing scripts and their purposes
   - Documented 9 action items for next session
   - Listed critical questions to answer

### 5. **Developed 4-Phase Normalization Strategy**
   - Phase 1: Audit & Understand current data
   - Phase 2: Standardize & Document algorithms
   - Phase 3: Backfill Missing Data consistently
   - Phase 4: Quality Assurance & Validation

## üìÇ FILES CHANGED

### Created:
- `docs/project-history/2025-09-21-cost-algorithm-and-data-backfill.md` (192 lines)
- `database-utilities/cost-coverage-check.js` (cost data coverage analysis script)
- `database-utilities/check-cost-coverage.js` (duplicate - needs cleanup)

### Modified:
- `CLAUDE.md` (Updated with latest session insights)

## üîß CODE CHANGES

### New Scripts Created:
1. **Cost Coverage Check Script** (`cost-coverage-check.js`)
   - Analyzes towns table for cost data completeness
   - Reports coverage percentages for each cost field
   - Identifies towns missing critical cost data
   - Provides breakdown by country and state

## üéØ PROBLEMS SOLVED

### 1. **Understanding Fragmented Cost System**
   - **Problem:** Multiple scripts with unclear purposes
   - **Solution:** Mapped each script's function and identified overlap
   - **Result:** Clear picture of cost calculation infrastructure

### 2. **Algorithm Discovery**
   - **Problem:** Unknown methodology for cost calculations
   - **Solution:** Analyzed existing scripts to extract formulas
   - **Result:** Documented multiplier-based approach with components

### 3. **Strategy Development**
   - **Problem:** No clear path for data normalization
   - **Solution:** Created 4-phase implementation plan
   - **Result:** Actionable roadmap for completion

## üí° KEY DISCOVERIES

1. **Existing Infrastructure is Solid**
   - The multiplier approach is well-thought-out
   - Country-specific adjustments make sense
   - Conservative rounding protects users

2. **Data Coverage Unknown**
   - Can't query database directly (API issues)
   - Multiple "fill" scripts suggest incomplete data
   - Need proper audit before backfill

3. **Consistency is Critical**
   - All towns must use same methodology
   - Data sources must be documented
   - Validation against real costs needed

## üìä CURRENT STATE

### What's Working:
- ‚úÖ Cost algorithm methodology documented
- ‚úÖ All existing scripts identified and mapped
- ‚úÖ Clear strategy for moving forward
- ‚úÖ Component breakdown understood

### Known Issues:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Database query access problems
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Unknown percentage of towns with cost data
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple overlapping scripts need consolidation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è claude-db-helper hardcoded for Alicante

### Database State:
- Towns table: 343 records
- Cost fields identified: 5+ columns
- Coverage: Unknown (needs audit)
- Algorithm: Multiplier-based with components

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Priority:
1. Fix database query access (claude-db-helper or alternative)
2. Run comprehensive cost data audit
3. Validate existing calculations against known costs
4. Identify data sources for missing towns

### Medium Term:
1. Consolidate 5+ scripts into one authoritative script
2. Document exact formulas and decision trees
3. Create validation rules and sanity checks
4. Plan backfill prioritization

### Long Term:
1. Achieve 100% cost data coverage
2. Implement regular update mechanism
3. Add confidence scores to estimates
4. Create user feedback loop for accuracy

## üîç SEARCH KEYWORDS

## üìù NOTES
- Session focused on discovery and planning rather than implementation
- Found existing infrastructure more comprehensive than expected
- Main challenge is consolidation and completion, not creation
- Conservative estimation approach (rounding up) is user-protective
- Need working database access for next session's audit

## ‚úÖ SESSION SUCCESS METRICS
- [x] Understood existing cost infrastructure
- [x] Documented calculation methodology
- [x] Created actionable strategy
- [x] Identified all relevant scripts
- [ ] Determined actual data coverage (blocked by access)
- [x] Developed validation approach
