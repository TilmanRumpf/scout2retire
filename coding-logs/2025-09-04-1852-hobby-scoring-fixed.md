# üü¢ RECOVERY CHECKPOINT - 2025-09-04-1852
## SYSTEM STATE: WORKING - Hobby Scoring Fixed

### ‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING
- **Hobby Scoring System (FINALLY!)**: All coastal towns now showing correct ~87% hobby match scores
- **Geographic Inference System**: Properly inferring hobby availability from town characteristics
- **Top Hobbies Integration**: Added missing `top_hobbies` field to all SQL queries (townUtils.jsx:56, matchingAlgorithm.js:143)
- **Database Storage**: User hobbies properly stored in both `onboarding_responses` and `user_preferences` tables
- **Weighted Scoring**: Distinctive (1.0), Inferred (0.8), Universal (0.5) weights working correctly
- **Favorites Page**: Displaying accurate personalized match scores for all towns
- **User Data Persistence**: Hobby selections saved to DATABASE, not localStorage

- **onboarding_responses.hobbies**: 
  ```json
  {
    "activities": ["water_sports", "water_crafts"],
    "interests": ["cooking_wine"],
    "travel_frequency": "rare"
  }
  ```
- **user_preferences**: Matching data synced
- **Towns**: 341 towns with top_hobbies populated

### üéØ WHAT WAS ACHIEVED
1. **Fixed 40-hour Case Sensitivity Bug**: Changed all geographic feature comparisons to use .toLowerCase()
2. **Resolved Missing Field Issue**: Added `top_hobbies` to all town queries
3. **Fixed Data Persistence**: Moved from localStorage to database storage
4. **Synchronized Tables**: Both `onboarding_responses` and `user_preferences` now have identical hobby data
5. **Hobby Expansion Working**: 
   - Water Sports ‚Üí 5 activities
   - Water Crafts ‚Üí 5 activities  
   - Cooking & Wine ‚Üí 3 interests
6. **Accurate Scoring**: Valencia, Alicante, Porto all showing ~87% hobby match

### üîç HOW TO VERIFY IT'S WORKING
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/favorites
2. Check hobby match percentages for coastal towns (should be ~87%)
3. Verify user's hobbies in database:
   ```sql
   SELECT hobbies FROM onboarding_responses WHERE user_id = '83d285b2-b21b-4d13-a1a1-6d51b6733d52';
   SELECT activities, interests FROM user_preferences WHERE user_id = '83d285b2-b21b-4d13-a1a1-6d51b6733d52';
   ```
4. Both should show: activities: ['water_sports', 'water_crafts'], interests: ['cooking_wine']

### ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN ISSUES
