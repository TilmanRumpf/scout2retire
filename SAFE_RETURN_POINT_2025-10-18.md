# ðŸ”’ SAFE RETURN POINT - October 18, 2025 20:45

## Critical Context
**BEFORE FIXING DATA NORMALIZATION ISSUE**
- Some towns (Nova Scotia + Bubaque) have field names as values instead of actual categorical values
- All other towns have correct values that match user preferences

## Database Snapshot
- **Created**: 2025-10-18T20-45-28
- **Towns**: 352 records
- **Users**: 14 records
- **User Preferences**: 13 records
- **Favorites**: 29 records

## To Restore Database
```bash
node restore-database-snapshot.js 2025-10-18T20-45-28
```

## Git State
- Latest commit before normalization fix
- All admin panels working with inline editing
- Dynamic textarea fix completed

## To Restore Code
```bash
git log --oneline -5  # Find this checkpoint
git reset --hard HEAD  # Or specific commit hash
```

## What's Working
âœ… All 11 tabs in Towns Manager functional
âœ… 148 editable fields across panels
âœ… Inline editing with immediate save
âœ… Dynamic textarea for long text
âœ… Most town data correctly normalized (except Nova Scotia & Bubaque)

## Known Issues to Fix
- Nova Scotia towns have field names as values
- Bubaque has field names as values (mobile_coverage, public_transport_quality, etc.)
- Dropdown options in admin panels don't match onboarding values

## Next Steps After Restore
If something goes wrong and you restore:
1. The data normalization issue will still need fixing
2. Focus only on Nova Scotia towns and Bubaque
3. Don't change other towns - their data is correct
