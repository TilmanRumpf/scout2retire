# Safe Return Point - January 24, 2025

## Current State
✅ **All 71 towns now visible in discover page**
- Fixed hardcoded 20-town limit in matching algorithm
- Increased TOWNS_PER_PAGE to 100 (loads all towns at once)
- Created cache clearing tool for localhost development issues

## Recent Commits

b808ffa Show all 71 towns in discover - fix 20 town limit
2205647 Fix infinite scroll by increasing initial load from 20 to 35 towns
2426603 Replace Load More button with infinite scroll
0c800c5 Add Load More button to see all towns
```

## Key Fixes Applied
1. **Regional matching fixed** - US states properly detected when stored as countries
2. **Coastal detection fixed** - Falls back to regions array when geographic_features_actual is null
3. **Dynamic region dropdown** - Now pulls from towns.geo_region column
4. **All towns visible** - No more artificial 20-town limit

## Safe Return Commands
```bash
# If something breaks, return to this point:
git checkout 33a63b8

# Or if you need to go back further to before infinite scroll:
git checkout 0c800c5
```
